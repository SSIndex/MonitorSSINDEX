https://www.yelp.com/biz/webster-bank-milford?osq=Webster Bank,Webster Bank,1,My husband and I have had a terrible experience with the mortgage department at Webster bank!!! They are disorganized and don't answer or return phone calls... did not help guide us or prepare us for possible hiccups... very disappointed in the service provided. The pandemic is no excuse I am a nurse I show up to work everyday and provide the best care possible probably give better service since family members are unable to visit! I will never use them again I can not wait to build my house and use a different lender !,[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",02/14/2021 16:19:02,1613319542,owm6nNK3ZHuD_tCQEFHupw,Dominique B.,0,0,9,"Hamden, CT",,fKFMzk5gCoyXMn7lvbPOxg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fKFMzk5gCoyXMn7lvbPOxg,,,,,

I have more than once witnessed the teller inside asking out loud for a social security number!  This last time the bank manager did not seem bothered by this.  I suppose this is normal???  Then the teller followed this with the person's home address!!!!  The name was provided earlier.  Is this for real?  a bank that we think is protecting out life savings is giving away our identity?  i am now looking at the smaller credit unions.   i would like to know which banks have skilled tellers.  Another issue of concern at this bank as well as others is the lack of customer service set up with opportunity for privacy...office to discuss personal financial matters allow for security /privacy!  while we have more identity theft, banks are giving away more information.",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",09/24/2015 03:58:23,1443067103,liJS69gm83dIukn2h2YVOw,Rob D.,0,0,16,"Stamford, CT",,bZqC4S8VVPm9DXvwW8juFg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bZqC4S8VVPm9DXvwW8juFg,,,,,
