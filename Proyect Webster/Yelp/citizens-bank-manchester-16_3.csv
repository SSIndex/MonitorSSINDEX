It seemed everything was fine and the application was complete. They had asked for a few more files which was normal. After all said and done, it got denied because nobody told me that I could not refinance under the pay as your earn repayment plan. I was heavily mislead and even opened and account with Citizens. I should have been told up front (not in fine print) all things that could keep me from being approved. I called up and they said their policy is that I need to be in standard repayment for 3 months, but will only hold my application for 90 days, making that physically impossible. Why would you even have that policy? I find I very unprofessional and will continue to give Citizens negative reviews due to being completely 100% mislead.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",07/05/2017 18:40:48,1499280048,99K6ygt-y65RF-uHiV7jfg,Eric P.,0,0,1,"Northford, CT",,FmbKHgZf8Gp-kw3yPWGpPw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FmbKHgZf8Gp-kw3yPWGpPw,,,,,
