What a scam.

Every time I come to this location I am met with rude tellers who are not interested in doing anything besides gossiping about each other and clients in front of them. Not only are they rude to me, but they're rude to the poor older people who come in asking for help. My card never works and they don't seem to know how to help me. I inevitably came in today asking to close my card and was told ""no."" And another woman said ""I just don't have time for that."" And then proceeded to go into the back and look at the sun with her eclipse glasses. I was handed a paper and told to wait... just to be seen by a worker about 10 minutes later who let me know nobody notified her I was there waiting.
