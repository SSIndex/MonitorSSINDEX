https://www.yelp.com/biz/citizens-bank-hartford-3?osq=Citizens Bank,Citizens Bank,1,"Opened both a checking and savings account to take advantage of a $600 cash bonus. Required to set up direct deposit of $500 for checking account to receive a $300 bonus, and make deposits of $200 for 3 months to receive and additional $300 bonus. Both accounts were opened in Dec 2021 and the bonuses were supposed to be deposited by Apr 30 2022. 

It's now May 9 2022. I have contacted Citizen's Bank twice and was told that I indeed qualified for the bonuses, but had to reach out to their Bonus specialist representative (exact title forgotten). I've called that department 5 times now. I've gotten one return phone call but missed it since I was at work. My 4 follow up calls have gotten no response. 

As soon as my bonuses are credited to my accounts, I will be closing them. If I can't trust a bank to pay what it has promised, why would I trust them to handle my money?",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",05/09/2022 15:28:49,1652110129,UAKJKTKryF6Ynz-hxyXXYQ,Kim W.,16,0,2,"Cheshire, CT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_hHs0aMqPhe247-fKIvOMA/180s.jpg,vay7Y5EFpxYTqnZ_OxA3-Q,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vay7Y5EFpxYTqnZ_OxA3-Q,,,,,
