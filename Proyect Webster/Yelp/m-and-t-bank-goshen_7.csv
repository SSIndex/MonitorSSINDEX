https://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-t-bank-goshen?osq=M&T bank,M&T Bank,5,"I usually only go to the ATM at this location.   Due to an issue with a fraudulent purchase being made from my account and luckily being in town I stopped in to see if I could resolve the problem in person.  

I'm happy to say that Gretchen was very helpful and honest.  She walked me through the process and explained that the problem may not be able to be fixed until the purchase posted (luckily the purchase was made that morning, so I knew within an hour).  She also helped me with reporting my card as stolen to avoid further issues.  

When I looked at my account on Monday I saw that the purchase had posted.  I went back to the branch, Gretchen was there and remembered my situation.  She helped me again and I received the money back in my account as promised.  I am likely to keep my account with M &T mostly because she was willing to help me.  I know that it's not the bank's fault, but the account is small and I was debating whether to close it out.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",10/11/2019 02:51:54,1570762314,Nso0kqB1q49f_wvR4px5aw,Jenn L.,3,9,77,"New Windsor, NY",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/tadop3QaT_2E5duouKpvDg/180s.jpg,qbAnzXWo0WiJrdzB3MHLXA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qbAnzXWo0WiJrdzB3MHLXA,,,,,
