I speak to a lady telling me that I will be transferred to the new accts department.  I explained that I don't need a new acct nor my call is regarding a new acct.  I need to remove a lien from a vehicle I purchased in an auction.  She continued to tell me she will repeat herself... and that will transfer me to the new acct department.  I told her I don't need a new acct or that this is not an acct 
 I'll like to open with them... I need to remove an existing acct rather... and she hung up on me... can any competitive person from this company help?...",['https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eh729pfG3CPcWbtKGoMoiQ/348s.jpg'],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 1, 'oh_no': 0}",05/10/2021 17:28:39,1620667719,wy5cGxe3gwY9m904ZrpZ0A,Estephany G.,46,1,9,"Mount Hope, KS",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/C0R4f8Kp9FF8knaZGZLWsg/180s.jpg,9pSu9LGFcBDBnnACEsZCsA,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9pSu9LGFcBDBnnACEsZCsA,,,,,
https://www.yelp.com/biz/fifth-third-bank-bloomfield-2?osq=Fifth Third Bank,Fifth Third Bank,1,I would give ZERO stars if I could.  I make payments on my mortgage principle and they claim that I have insufficient funds in the bank the funds are drawn on.  I believe this is because  1)their incompetence and 2) their lack of desire for me to hurry up and get out of their their terrible bank! Customer service has been absolutely awful:  they can't answer questions and hang up on you when they say they are transfering you to the mortgage department.  I regret having them carry my mortgage.  I am trying to pay it off as fast as possible so I can get rid of them.  DO NOT do any mortgage business with this company.,[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",04/08/2023 13:10:52,1680959452,npbrNREa6HNCebOW0PRvzQ,Becca B.,0,0,2,"New York, NY",,5Z5ckxgBy8pngESvI2ovfQ,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5Z5ckxgBy8pngESvI2ovfQ,,,,,
