Although they have their thoughts together, I can't stress enough about the bad rates and fees this bank has.  And it isn't just the whole Red Hook branch that get's me wondering how they are getting away with these high rates for so long?  I was in here a few times during 2011(mainly to change coins to bills and bills to coins) and each time I felt like this was the wrong decision to make.  I know it was an even switch, but it just doesn't seem like this is a reputable place.  I mean, the floors look clean and all, so it's not that, but something else; it's just not right what their customers have to go through, when they bank with M&T.  It seems like they have fees for all sorts of things(even more than what Bank of America is beginning to charge their customers).  I don't know.  My mom left the bank, my grandma left the bank, and so did my father.  It used to be an okay bank to use, when it was First National of Rhinebeck/of the Hudson Valley, but now, well, I'm never going to use it, unless I'm changing money from one to another or simple transactions that don't involve saving money, here.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",07/22/2012 20:27:30,1342988850,k3yyGvnyMiiHBFJF6gwvag,Christopher B.,4,660,1095,"Red Hook, NY",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/JZktAZwnHwvmQWJS25Tvzw/180s.jpg,jjDyqPj4d-FZt3ktZrKxbw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jjDyqPj4d-FZt3ktZrKxbw,,,,,
