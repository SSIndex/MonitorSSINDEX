https://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-t-bank-mohegan-lake?osq=M&T bank,M&T Bank,1,"This is my first ever one star review. I am incredibly disgusted with the poor service and misinformation that I have received from this bank. 

I have a joint account with my mom who passed away from Covid. I called the branch to close the account. They said because I do not live in ny I have to contact the 800 number and they can close the account.

I called the 800 number and waited on hold for nearly 30 minutes. They then told me they couldn't close the account until it had a zero balance. So I emptied the account and called back two days later. I waited on hold for 21 minutes only to be told that I had to close the account in person. I explained that I did not live in ny. I was told to simply send a signed letter asking to close the account directly to the branch. I couldn't believe that was all I had to do after getting bumped around so I contacted the branch. They told me no, the 800 number was not correct and that the letter had to be notarized. 

This bank has my signature on file and has wasted too much of my time already. They simply have no clue what they are doing.
