So I decided to join this location. I'm really happy that I did because the staff go above and beyond to help you but one in particular named Corey Not only goes above and beyond but always has a smile no matter how long his line is or how overwhelmed he may be... I don't know if he is or not because he always carry that genuine smile and never forgets to ask how you want your money. Even my dog loves him because he gives him treats. Lol Thank you so much Corey You're certainly impressive to watch As the line moves from 15 people to 2 In about 5 minutes. You always make my day!

Not only did the person who helped me (very slowly) try to tell me they are a ""very good bank"" - they operate as if it is 1922, not 2022, and I *had* to go to the branch to get the money out of my account -- so I could put it into my new account (Capital One Bank - all online - has been very good so far for ex-People's customers dealing with this bank). 

She had me fill out a paper *withdrawal slip* (and this is because their website won't allow you to transfer funds from one bank to another - again - 2022...) and then gave me a check - and noted ""the pink copy is so you have one for your records."" As if I wasn't just going to take a photo of it and deposit it into my account?

It was a nightmare. Although we were promised that everything would remain the same, including our ID's and passwords to get into our online banking, nothing worked. I spent over an hour at the bank to correct the problem.

While waiting for assistance, there was a table full of promos with M & T logo. While I was looking at a particular item that attached to my cell phone that enabled me to put cards into the back of the phone someone attached it without my permission. I have not been able to get the sticky glue off the back of my phone since. It is a mess. 

Finally, the configuration of the online banking site is a horrific. It is difficult to negotiate and read.  People's had a wonderful system and I am going to miss their service.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-t-bank-fairfield?osq=M&T bank,M&T Bank,1,"The fusion of Peoples United Bank and M&T has gone to the detriment of customer service quality to the point that many like me have decided to take their businesses to other banking entities.

The situation is so serious that even the safety of customers and their accounts are questioned, in my case a transaction between banking entities came out of my account but  never arrived at the other bank and nobody knows how to answer what happened or where the money went , we fill a claim in the bank and it is expected that it is back in 7 working days, but the transfer that was already approved to be executed monthly had to be canceled forcing me to do it manually since I do not trust the operation of this bank.

The waiting time including the calls of the same bank employees when they call with the client present to solve any situation can take more than 30 minutes of waiting, to solve the situation at the Belden Ave branch, Norwalk, CT.

By merging; all travel notices for example, was eliminated causing difficulties in the use of cards abroad, took me 2 hours one day and 3 the next to be able to communicate with an agent from abroad, but not even so I could solve the problem.

When the telephone application is use, you have to constantly receive a verification code, the problem is that there are times that the code simply does not arrive and if you try several times the access to the account is blocked and you have to go through the martyrdom of the verification that can be A cumbersome process that takes a long time.

This fusion has affected Peoples in a harmful way, and without a doubt the option is to get out of this entity to other more serious ones that do not have you waiting for hours for a consultation and after waiting get an unreasonable agent without training that do not know what he/she is doing, summarizing you have to leave before something more serious happens.",[],"{'helpful': 0, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",10/06/2022 15:36:21,1665070581,lFkrDPjVMntwE0WpwdfehA,Rick F.,0,0,5,"Norwalk, CT",,R1ZdCpvRmNPx7wesveu0Rw,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=R1ZdCpvRmNPx7wesveu0Rw,,,,,
