I finally called to order a new card and expedite  ut. I was told $25.00 to get in on 3 days.  I said I've been a customer for over 32 years, could they waive the fee? They checked with higher ups and I was told ....NO. I said nicely, not great customer service,  they said sorry followed by thanks for being a great loyal customer.
