Mr. Vernon was very understanding, was very professional and took his time to correct the issue and after quite a few weeks of tussle, closed the account and made me a happier individual. At first I was very upset and very hard to deal with but Mr. Vernon is the go to guy. He saved the day and my sanity. Otherwise Its a great local bank. Thank you all.

What sets this M&T branch apart from others that I've frequented is the wonderful customer service that I consistently receive while banking inside.  It more than makes up for the somewhat confusing parking lot that can tend to be an issue for some people.
