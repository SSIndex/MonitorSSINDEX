In West Hartford for Easter and really needed to deposit a check that was in my wallet (""was""... ha!  It's still there!) so after determining that a Citizens ATM was indeed in town, I went a few miles out of my way, parked and tried to go in.

But, what's this??  A 24 hour ATM behind a door that does not open???  Um, what's up with that, Citizens?
