The bank was a convenient walk from my house and, with a few exceptions, the staff was efficient, helpful, and friendly.  Those who weren't around for long.  When I moved to Cold Spring I was very pleased to find an M&T branch even nearer my house.  Again the staff was very good, including the new branch manager who was hired fairly recently.

While most everyone in here is lovely,  the branch manager is extremely unprofessional,  and downright rude. Zero interest in customer service, and or helping out her clients. I had heard this from several people, but had never had any dealings with her, until today. I am sad to report that I too now have been exposed to this. Disheartening,  because we place our money with a bank, trusting them with our livelihoods and then get treated as if we are disposable.",[],"{'helpful': 1, 'thanks': 0, 'love_this': 0, 'oh_no': 0}",09/10/2014 20:34:04,1410381244,_Qc1veEoprzAZwsjPkAOAw,Kendell M.,112,0,7,"Mount Pleasant, Charleston, SC",,mjouAKYjvb-Wxe3SLvpKRg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mjouAKYjvb-Wxe3SLvpKRg,,,,,
