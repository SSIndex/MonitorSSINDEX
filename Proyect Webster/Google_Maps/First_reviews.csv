His patience is unparalleled especially with some of my antics and multiple questions that sometimes sounded like a broken record repeating itself. He never rushed me and allowed me to go at my own pace but encouraged urgency, which just made it way easier for me. He was great at reminding me on the things I needed to because I am forgetful but he did it with kindness. 100 out of 10 I recommend him to anyone and everyone.",5,Alabama,ChIJbX0yFdYbiYgRcSAs6V7ODRY

Now it is First Horizon but I'm loyal to Tina Jenkins who has always answered my calls or my random walk-ins to advise me on numerous financial issues. I recently stoped in and she was there to help me reset a login on my computer because it was locked.
Twice I needed LLC paperwork to sign and she dropped it off at my loft on the street as she was leaving on her way home.

10/02/2021 00:40:38,William Bradford,"I work for a Construction company and the owner chooses to write us checks and use this bank. I walked in today like I would any other Friday to cash my check (which they charge us $7.50 to cash THEIR own checks!) And upon my arrival into the establishment an older Caucasian woman held the door for me...I walked in and turned to thank her. But before I could do so she was scolding me for stepping on their welcome mat. Exclaiming that ""yall"" (blue collar construction workers) ""always come in here and have red mud on your boots because of the type of work you choose to do."" Now I'm a CDL driver, I havent been in any mud or tracked anything in, but I did have some dust on the top of my boots and wouldn't have minded trying to keep this location cleaner had she not greater me with animosity and disqust. She told me that they had just had their mats cleaned and she didn't want us to ruin them. The mats did not show any signs of being vacuumed or cleaned at all seeing as they had  gray stains on them. The lady then proceeded to cash my check, never once apologizing, but told me that she ""waived the cashing fee"" for cashing a check that her institution backed. I guess I'm going to start waiting on the 2 day hold time at my own institution of banking because I don't want to pay $7.50 per check just to be looked down on because I'm a blue collar worker trying to make a living like everyone else. Would not recommend this bank to my own worst enemy.",1,Alabama,ChIJL6hO6pYbiYgRLk4cNEHEhqA

04/12/2019 15:09:32,Sam Johnson,"Discrimination at it finest, my husband came in to cash a check this morning and was assisted by Amber the assistant branch manager. The check was drawn on this bank which is the only reason he came here to begin with; she proceeds to “verify” the check and takes another “verification” step after his two forms of identification were provide by calling the owner of the business and then calling the other owner under the pretense that the  printed business not handwritten check “looks” different for this business, might I add this particular location for  the business has been open approximately 3 weeks and most employees are paid via direct deposit. Then she attempted to justify her actions after realizing that her conversation had been heard.

He felt as if the “check” didn’t look different, the “individual”cashing it looked different as he was dressed in plain clothes vs a suit and tie he’d typically have on. In my 16 plus years in banking and him being a successful realtor in the state have never seen or been treated as such by a financial institution; iberiabank is forever off the table for us to consider using for any of our clients or our own financial needs. That will not have any effect on the quarterly earnings of this business but I hope and pray it has an affect on your conscience on how you treat people whose skin color may be different Ms Amber. All for a check under 2k. Definitely a coaching opportunity Iberiabank management team!

It was not opened correctly and I was not able to access the account through mobile for a week. 2 - 3 weeks later my balance is in the negative due to account fees and the NSF fees, my account was a free small business acct.. Turns out some how my account was converted to an account with fees and now I do my first check deposit over the weekend and forgot to sign the check. The gentleman that I spoke with said since it was a commercial account it will deposit anyway. Wake up this morning to find the check deposit rejected and now I have NSF fees again. Go in with the check to deposit most of it and take some cash so I can mail off orders and am told I am not allowed to take cask out even if I owned the account. The gentleman then told me that since I didn't sign the check the mobile deposit wouldn't go through.

Unfortunately, the wonderful staff at the Fultondale branch had no control in the bank switching over. First Horizons policies are just to make them richer. Before the switch it didn't matter if you deposited cash or check it instantly credited to your account immediately. Now a check won't credit until the next business day. Another issue, my account had no monthly fee because of my husband's SS check being direct deposit.  In order to keep my account free I had to sign up for electronic statements or else I would have had to pay $10/ month for my account.",3,Alabama,ChIJtXcYK_IEiYgRtiRz9tq0_Zs

Whether by phone or in person, their agents are always knowledgeable, courteous & efficient. For example: I've misplaced my debit card several times over the years & all it took was a phone call to cancel it & then to visit any of their physical branches to have a new one issued immediately, and no additional charges. They will mail a new card if you want, but picking one up was faster. On the few occasions that there have been suspicious activity on my account, it is quickly & courteously rectified.
I originally chose First TN b/c their physical locations were open later & on Saturday's. Their hrs have changed, however with their new ATM's at each locations, cash deposits are immediately credited & there are no forms or envelopes to bother with. Same day check deposits are credited at midnight if you deposit them by 9 pm.

04/08/2021 20:05:57,Skull Lover,"This bank did me so wrong!! I loathed banks for awhile after the encounter I had with this one... I would never recommend this bank to anyone!! The employees were very rude.. They closed my account without notifying me. THEN somehow they charged my account weeks after that. THEN about 2 month later they sent in a letter saying that they closed it and needed me to pay the fees that were charged to the “closed account”. So I went and loaned some money from my mother to pay my fees off. About a good 6 months maybe later I went to First Community to setup an account and the lady told me that Iberia is stating that I owe them money. I told her I had payed off the fees and I really don’t know why they’re still saying I owe them. She went on to say she can still help me setup an account with First Community.  I’ve been with them every since with no regrets..

My go to bank at the moment is First Community Bank. Their customer service is great. Some employees are respectful.. There’s no misinformation, false statements or hidden fees.",1,Arkansas,ChIJG_3V01T004cRIZTthb87BtM

I was told 3 different amounts before my procedure & than they cancelled my procedure anyway..Apparently they have 2 different billing methods that the billing can’t even get straight lol I finally said I’ll just do my MVA instead & forget about the rest, they denied me that as well..BAD BUSINESS!!!",1,Arkansas,ChIJ9Q4E56fA1ocRthaaA6LyK0U

The old time local banker is back and you can find the personal care at Iberiabank.  They have the same online systems, but better.

05/06/2022 02:02:33,Brianna Williams,"Sharon was awful, assuming she was the branch manager, she shouldn't have been.

I felt racially profiled and disturbed that I realized I had an overdraft on a company I was relaunching. I just invested into restarting it up and wanted to review access my account.

I WENT IN TO PAY A FEE and get a replacement card.

God forbid Sharon would let me pay what I owed them. She was doing everything besides allowing me to keep my bank in good standing.

She made the teller, Diane I believe, visibly uncomfortable and was micromanaging her.

I find it funny she went through my bank statements to see why I wanted to pay the return fee of an old transaction and what I would be doing with MY account.

Mind you, I have a new benz, designer and I was well kept for a Thursday bank run.

This woman made me uncomfortable to the point I stopped everything, told her to rip up my check and left.

10/27/2021 16:40:56,Randy Caputo,"First, the staff at this branch are very helpful and friendly. Convenient location, plenty of parking and a drive through window.
Second, I am very disappointed in the bank. We opened a checking, savings and credit card account online six weeks ago.  I tried to make a $3,500 mobile deposit. I was met with a $250 limit on both accounts. I emailed the bank on Friday evening asking why. I didn't receive a response until Tuesday. I guess they were off Monday. On Monday I called the local branch and asked them why. Was told that it was bank policy, that it would be lifted after 90 days but they would contact the main bank and see if it could be lifted. On Tuesday they said sorry but they wouldn't lift it. I then called customer service. My mistake, I got a young man that wasted my time, asked a bunch of questions and then said it was bank policy based on alpa rythems could not be changed. I said they should put that in big letters when you open an account, he then made a smart remark about still being able to deposit at a atm or the branch, even though we were talking about mobile deposits. I asked to talk to his boss, was told they don't take calls and then was told he was contacting security, I asked why, because of my attitude, really, then said I needed to talk to his boss. He said he would have him call me. Lol Still waiting. I do not recommend this bank. They don't care about their customers.",1,Florida,ChIJbQ3PEZ_i2IgRf8he0KnSfB4

In the beginning the teller explained me that she will not change my bill, because the bill could be counterfeit. Everything is possible, I received these bills from TD bank in NJ, I used part of them during my way to Florida and finally I met a very careful person in US bank who is scared not to recognize quality of $10 dollars bill. After that I was send to the ATM outside of the office. Two times I started transaction to withdraw $100 from my account in TD bank. I received the messages that transaction fee will be $3, but I did not received any money. The first time I met so unprofessional and not friendly office. I want to give minus 10 stars, but unfortunately it is impossible. P.S. Next day I stopped by Well Fargo and after 6 minutes I finished with transaction and had my bills in needed nomination.

They turned me away because I was not a ""customer."" I called to complain and the branch manager explained that with the world we live in, my bill could've been counterfeit. God forbid they check the damned thing with a counterfeit pen. Poor customer service in my opinion. Why turn any potential customer away when we have so many options in today's competitive market? I will gladly drive across town to my current bank where they treat me with a bit of respect. Hell, I might've even withdrew that $10 bill out of their ATM and paid the withdrawal fee.

The online group recommended that I go to a local branch to validate my identification. The teller kept asking me what was the purpose of my business!  I began to feel like I was answering the question with the wrong answer. She discussed with her manager and the manager proceeded to tell me they could not open an account for me but she really didn’t seem interested in telling me why or fixing whatever issue they may have found. She walked back into her office as if my business was not worthy or fake. This is a small bank and I thought they would want to help small business.

When someone uses your debit card to steal your money they will not dispute the transactions or help you in anyway. when you try to call to speak to someone about the issue you're not allowed to call and speak to anyone. There is only a generic customer service agent that will only direct you to call your local bank. From there someone from the local bank will call you and tell you to get screwed but you were already screwed because you've been banking with Iberia.There is something seriously wrong with this bank.  I have read other reviews on other review sites that talk about Iberia Bank freezing their funds once they were receiving large deposits from their business.I have also read about Iberia Bank employees stealing from accounts. When I first opened the account it took over two weeks to receive my debit card. Anytime I try to call to change my address or do anything with the account I am told that I have to go inside of the bank. This is the most incompetent and inconvenient bank then I have ever dealt with. They close at 4 and there is never anyone inside the bank doing business.

Upon submitting the check to the teller who appears to be from India or Pakistan, she requested 2 forms of ID from me, as it was a normal procedure, I submitted 2 government ID. She then began to type on her computer and called the issuer of the check, so far, so good, the teller then told me that she could only give me half of the amount and the other half as a cashiers check at a cost of 8 dollars, I agreed, she then asked me for my social security number which i reluctantly gave to her.  As she kept keying on the computer for more than ten minutes, I realized that she was conducting a research on my person as she was noting some of my personal detailed info on a separate sheet of paper. After about 15 minutes, she asked me for my occupation and by that time, I began to get angry but told her that I am now retired, she then asked me what was my previous occupation and, by that time, i was fuming and ask her why all of these questions just to cash a check and she responded by saying ""it is a requirement of the federal government ever since 911"", I told her that was a lie. I  asked her if she wanted to also know how many times i went to the bathroom yesterday or if I am gay or straight  or how many sexual encounters i had this past month, i was angry. As she and some of her supervisors realized the amplitude of my anger, a supervisor surreptitiously signaled to her to return the check back to me, un-cashed. THE POINT HERE, we are back into the past, is it GESTAPO TIME ONCE MORE IN THE USA...OR RACISM. In addition, it may be the right time for people to realize that banks are infringing more and more onto our personal lives and as punishment, may some day decide to not honor the withdrawal of our deposited funds....IT'S GETTING THERE FOLKS..... AN ALTERNATIVE TO BANKS IS URGENTLY NEEDED. Several other people have had similar experiences with banks .... BEWARE .....",1,Florida,ChIJXUqghsMH2YgRMtUGe9RMSIo

I called the bank and they sent me docs to review and sign - only problem was they sent me docs with a completely different person's FULL Social Security Number, address, phone number, etc. I called to talk with them about this and they just said ""can you delete the email?""

A week later I walked into this branch asking about opening a business savings account again and they said they were a understaffed and asked if I needed to open it that day. There was no one there except me.

Probably best to look somewhere else for your banking needs.",1,Georgia,ChIJsZDOqjAQ9YgRXVy7OGH9f30

I been their customer (Georgia commerce) now Iberia for few years. I work few minutes away from this branch but rather to drive a little bite more and hit their other branch in Buckhead since I live in Atlanta. It's been the almost the same people that's  been working and maybe its time for a change. Jessi the branch manager would almost do anything not to help you or avoid you always portending he's busy doing something on his computer/phone. You would get a better attitude from Wells Fargo tellers even tho they see 100 people. The head teller is just a dry cut lady with no customer service what so ever.  I would use Iberia bank but just refuse to go this one.,1,Georgia,ChIJsZDOqjAQ9YgRXVy7OGH9f30
02/23/2019 00:30:10,Renita Crawley,"This BANK IS HORRIBLE!!!! I WAS WRONGFULLY TARGETED!!!!

Tuesday 2/19 at 9:00am- I was excited to open a business account for the 1st time. I thought I had all my documents, but I was missing my EIN number. Riley told me I could get the IRS to fax the information to bank. But in the meantime, he could set-up my personal account. While he was doing that, I was looking up the IRS number on my phone. When I got on the IRS web page it would not let me click the number to dial. So, I got Riley's sticky note cards on his desk write the number down.

I call the IRS but shortly hung-up because the lady that was assisting Riley told me that she another number which was essential the same number I JUST dialed previous.

I was a bit aggravated because I was already waiting on hold for 7 minutes and I had another appointment to attend 10:00 AM.  I gather my things and left.

Few hours later I got a call from Riley asking, I did I accidentally grip a business card when I was gathering my things?

So, I search my car, purse, wallet but I didn't see it. I give him a call back to confirm told him I'll be back on Friday to finish the business account.

Friday, 2/22 3:15PM- 2nd try to open the business account. When I arrived, I told the lady at the front desk I wanted to open a business account and I have the IRS on the line to fax my EIN. The lady that was helping me didn't even know the bank had a fax machine. The was the 1st flag! The IRS confirm the fax was sent the 2 lady claimed they didn't receive it. So they provide me with another fax number the IRS confirmed again it was send. The lady received it but didn't see my personal profile set-up yet and Riley had to finish it to gain credit for the account. 2nd red flag! I was under the impression Riley set-up my personal account on Tuesday as he stated......

I go to Riley's desk. He asked me look through my purse again for the business card. I did and I found it in my wallet mixed in with the other business cards, I apologized and gave it back to him. In my mind it was a total accident. No big deal. Suddenly, the lady from Tuesday that give me the same number for IRS comes over and accuses me of stealing a business card and needed an explanation. I told it was a total mistaken it was NOT intentional.  Riley and this lady when back and forth with me over a BUSINESS CARD of a PERSON I DO NOT KNOW or CARE to KNOW!!!! They were asking why would I do that? Why would I take bank property information? We saw the cameras and saw you put it in your purse. AS IF I WAS A CRIMINAL!!! They made me feel like I was a THIEF and discriminated against!

I'm TELLING THESE FOLKS IT WAS A PURE ACCIDENT!!!! WHY IN THE HELL I WOULD WANT BUSINESS CARD FROM SOMEONE I DO NOT KNOW!!! They are in cahoots together saying we are trying to know why too. During this process, I felt harassed and discriminated against. After all of that they asked me are you sure you still want to open your account. Red flag number 3!!! Deep inside I didn't because I thought those actions were not called for but....

Since I just drove from Forest Park, GA to Smyrna, GA during my lunch break, was on hold with the IRS for 35 minutes to get my EIN faxed and I had ALL my paperwork I just needed my account now so I could go!

They Riley started acting like my EIN number was not valid even though the IRS JUST FAXED....

After an hour and a half later, he provides me with a rejection letter stating they cannot open my account with no indication of why!!!!!

NOW, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS DEEPER MATTER AND I FEEL BEING WRONGFULLY TARGETED!!!

Please see the attachment below: (As you can see there is no REAL reason checked why I could not open an account)

After this experience I would not RECOMMEND ANYONE to BANK HERE!

I work too hard to give my hard-earned money to an organization like this!

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!!",1,Georgia,ChIJsZDOqjAQ9YgRXVy7OGH9f30

The staff was very helpful and professional...the branch manager on the other hand needs to be demoted, seriously. This man tried to keep my payroll check when i went to open a new account!! My payroll check has SIX SECURITY features on it!!!! How is it that a simple cashier knows what security features to look for on a check to see if it's legit or not....but a bank branch manager has no clue at all about security features that are put on checks to verify if they are legit?????? My first and very last experience with the very unprofessional bank and branch!! Your branch manager needs some serious retraining and customer service classes as you lost a potential customer the very first encounter that was trying to open another checking account and transfer $20,000 over to your bank. I just wonder, how many other potential customers and business accounts did your branch lose because of the extra things your branch manager does to go Out Of The Way to make sure not to help a customer!!!! And he didnt even read the back on the check and look for this info!!!!!!",1,Georgia,ChIJcad3LEEU9YgRF0dC_P4fInc

Additionally we haven't been able to access the account online. It says we have an account setup but it's locked. When we call customer service, they say we don't have a profile and they can't create one for us. In my opinion, this is a predatory lender and as soon as we are able, we will get out from under this loan.

Unfortunately, according to the branch manager, Iberiabank's underwriting department does not pay attention to detail and performs a credit check is if they were me.

We were falsely denied a business credit card and small line of credit based upon completely false reasons (time in business was inaccurate, credit reports were not pulled as a hard inquiry showing the complete picture, etc.).

I was able to secure a business Amex and 2 other credit cards, as well as a personal mortgage. So clearly I am a good risk with ample revenue/income and a positive credit history.

Whether by phone or in person, their agents are always knowledgeable, courteous & efficient. For example: I've misplaced my debit card several times over the years & all it took was a phone call to cancel it & then to visit any of their physical branches to have a new one issued immediately, and no additional charges. They will mail a new card if you want, but picking one up was faster. On the few occasions that there have been suspicious activity on my account, it is quickly & courteously rectified.
I originally chose First TN b/c their physical locations were open later & on Saturday's. Their hrs have changed, however with their new ATM's at each locations, cash deposits are immediately credited & there are no forms or envelopes to bother with. Same day check deposits are credited at midnight if you deposit them by 9 pm.

Poor customer service. Especially the rinngold and St. Elmo branches. Branches have far too much control making it whereas the bank overall when you call when cannot help you.

I have bought several homes and have built two up north and out west. Honestly, I have been working with this first Horizon for about three months and I was getting conflicting information on different things. I was told one thing and then another thing and was dragged out was an emotional roller coaster for me and my family I was like what the  he double hockey sticks !! definitely not an experience like I’ve ever had and I’ve bought houses in multiple states prior wasn’t upfront with me about the FHA guidelines and was told different things at several different times that didn’t make sense and that didn’t help we wound up not going through with the Loan I know it’s not all on them but they should be and should help with the financial part of the process and at least let you know what has  to be done in a timely manner and let me know what’s going on throughout the whole process I felt like I was told something different every few days , like I said earlier each day, also throughout the process, they hit my credit four different times and dropped my score by 10 points. I have to wait a year and a half now for all of these hard inquiries to come off, as well as the rate, went up in the middle of the process as well, so they never locked the rate in so do yourself a favor and check out rocket mortgage SoFI ,or some thing like that you’re better off Worst experience I’ve had dealing with someone trying to get a house. I don’t recommend at all if I could give zero stars I would. Also to boot we lost our 4K in earnest money and thankfully our realtor with chucktown homes made it right and is getting us out funds back ,but feel bad it’s coming out of his personal money now this is ridiculously insane do yourself a favor and shop around !!!! Also this guy did not help in the least bit to get this loan closed plain and simple",1,Georgia,ChIJ-UN1hsm5-ogRVt8N9PH3lZA

Do not hesitate to hire this team as your lender. They are communicative, efficient, transparent, knowledgeable advocates!

The loan was ready to close early, and we were able to close on the home earlier than anticipated, even before 30 days!! Not only did their team communicate well with me, they coordinated with my realtor and the closing attorney and included me on the emails. This made it easy for me to know where I was at in the process at all times.

I have many services through First Horizon, and this experience with Justin was the best.  He never pushed me off onto his assistant (like the wealth management guys do), and he ALWAYS returned my calls, texts, or emails in person. This has not been my experience with First Horizon in the past, and I hope they are turning over a new leaf.  I often get excuses about how busy they are or how they have a new assistant, but with Justin I just got answers and never a single complaint.

I have had multiple instances where I was unable to access the money in my account due to technical challenges on their end, the mobile app is buggy, have had difficult times trying to contact people by phone, and was talked out of trying to take out an auto loan many years ago... not denied, mind you, but strongly suggested to not pursue it, despite having okay credit.

You are mandating that people take out more than need. In come cases they would not be putting there money it in the bank if they could budget.

The one down side to this location is that the ATM machine has been out of order several times over the last couple of years. That can be extremely frustrating.

Why I asked? she replied only that no one asked for them. For those who don't know the Jefferson is the $2 bill. They are great during Christmas time, small anniversaries and even birthdays. These bills are rarely saying that's why they make such great gifts!

I will close out my account here and will bank elsewhere. I’ve used three branches and they’ve all failed miserable on customer service and ease of use.

I ask to speak to the manager, who later came from lunch. “Keisha” went to brief the manager before I spoke with her . I spoke with the manager who did nothing in my opinion but pacified me right out the door. Oh Keisha didn’t even show any interest or concern for my problem and me as a customer.

12/14/2018 19:35:36,John Langan,"One teller, at 1 pm on a Friday! She’s stuck working with a customer on some CD problem in the meantime I sit and wait and wait and wait. Why have a bank even open on a Friday at 1 pm with just one teller??
This is absolutely ridiculous, and very frustrating. I know they don’t have many customers in this particular neighborhood so that why I’m guessing they are so short staffed.
Where is management??
This gentleman in front of me should have his CD problem handled by a manager in a office instead of tying up the only cashier. This is why I don’t have my regular accounts here. Too damn slow!",1,Illinois,ChIJj-niE8aAf4gRqv1RnYScs-k

Notwithstanding an appointment scheduled by a teller [who was in the lunch room], 15 minutes past the time she scheduled, a mistake was made by Iberia Bank regarding its own procedures [admitted to by the manager].

Essentially all Iberia Bank personnel, were simply unsympathetic to our circumstances, but more importantly, unprofessional to the extent that the customer experienced a hardship created by Iberia Bank.

Additionally, a legal representative was suppose to contact us [the client] and discuss our concerns but instead contacted the supervising manager who stone walled us to the point of complete frustration.

I was able to open up a checking account AND received my ATM/VISA DEBIT CARD on the spot! It only took about 15 minutes and I was all set! Thank you very much!

My daughter recently started her first job and needed an account for direct deposit. We arrived shortly after 3pm.  We were immediately acknowledged by staff and directed to a desk that would be able to handle our request. A very personable member of the team, that was actually headed out for another engagement, and quite dapperly dressed I might add, offered water and showed us to some nice comfy chairs where we could wait.  When this same team member realized that it would be more than a few minutes before we would be helped, he came over to retrieve us to handle our request instead.  Guys, he was the Vice President!!!  Nicholas Collins far exceeded my expectations.  He purposefully and smoothly conversed with my daughter and told her how awesome it was for her to have her first job and commended on her intentions to save her money. I couldn't be more proud of my community!!!  Thank you Mr. Collins and First Horizon Bank of Hendersonville, you truly put your customers first!",5,Illinois,ChIJ8QUh1dJGZIgRpVYgToJZW7I

I have seen a revolving door with the personnel, and most of the time, they don't even acknowledge you ( even when it is not busy).  This bank is not people friendly, sending your needs to their corporate office and wasting your time. I am trying to be nice with 2 stars... but they have changed ownership and name  and were about to merge again, so it's iffy as to their permanent residency in Clarksville .",2,Kentucky,ChIJD-uZT_ohZYgRk_V6FI370-U

I withdrew money from the machine and received a receipt saying my money was dispensed - but it actually was not dispensed. I immediately contacted my bank who said it could take up to a couple weeks to resolve. I called the First Horizon Bank who said there was nothing they can do and I could visit the branch. I visited the branch and they said that there is nothing they can do … I have to wait for my bank to file a claim.

I waited 2 days then decided to call the main customer service number. Customer service said the ACH request had never been received, so Customer Service sent the ACH unit an email and said it would be acted on that day or by the next.

04/01/2024 15:14:36,Kenneth Rowell,"After a recent motorcycle accident I crutched myself into the Scott branch to cash a check from an insurance company that was drawn on this bank. I was asked for my ID and social security number, but when I started to tell them  my number they said that they needed to see my actual social security card! I asked if any of them carried their S.S. cards with them and of course, nobody answered. So I limped out to my truck and took a look at their policy, which does not mention a S.S. card requirement to cash a check. I then called the next nearest location and they were as stunned as I was and also mentioned that this branch is known for being a pain in the @$$ with things like that. I drove over to this other branch and I was taken care of in a matter of a few minutes. I'll never use the Scott branch again and I hope they get to see this review. Hopefully it will have some sort of impact and First Horizon will straighten out those mean old ladies and have them stick to policy.",1,Louisiana,ChIJYfHqYcqeJIYR--acmYIFFZo

We had an issue with about charge appearing to be fraudulent; despite me calling to advise otherwise, they STILL failed to lift the block off the card & several charges were declined. I had to CALL BACK the next day to confirm AGAIN the charge was valid. While that may not seem like an issue, for a BUSINESS this is time consuming and you lose money on man hours correcting an issue that NEVER SHOULDVE BEEN.

03/03/2022 17:17:10,Joelle arrington,Have had an account with Iberia for almost 20 years. They transitioned to first horizon. The app doesn't work. The customer service line is a joke. No one can help you even In person at the bank they have you call the 800 number. DONT BOTHER! Open an account at a different bank.,1,Louisiana,ChIJkbGlZH2GO4YRWpFRpJQw26U
08/07/2021 17:30:32,Honest American,"Worst bank ever I mean seriously this bank is a joke.  I have never had so much trouble on a business account accessing my money went through the drive-through today and they would only let me withdraw a $1000.  Then the young male drive-through attendant wanted to give me attitude. They don't print instant debit cards, they hold deposits even when you have 20k plus in your account. Go somewhere else to open your account. Trust me you will regret opening it here especially at this branch. This one is the worst customer service out of all of them.",1,Louisiana,ChIJkbGlZH2GO4YRWpFRpJQw26U

I was able to open up a checking account AND received my ATM/VISA DEBIT CARD on the spot! It only took about 15 minutes and I was all set! Thank you very much! I am super satisfied and as Kelley would say: ""ROGER THAT!"".

My daughter recently started her first job and needed an account for direct deposit. We arrived shortly after 3pm.  We were immediately acknowledged by staff and directed to a desk that would be able to handle our request. A very personable member of the team, that was actually headed out for another engagement, and quite dapperly dressed I might add, offered water and showed us to some nice comfy chairs where we could wait.  When this same team member realized that it would be more than a few minutes before we would be helped, he came over to retrieve us to handle our request instead.  Guys, he was the Vice President!!!  Nicholas Collins far exceeded my expectations.  He purposefully and smoothly conversed with my daughter and told her how awesome it was for her to have her first job and commended on her intentions to save her money. I couldn't be more proud of my community!!!  Thank you Mr. Collins and First Horizon Bank of Hendersonville, you truly put your customers first!",5,Maine,ChIJ8QUh1dJGZIgRpVYgToJZW7I

07/23/2020 17:08:39,Brytne Vinson,"I have been coming to this very location since I opened my first bank account. I have had the privilege to watch this branch evolve over time. The thing that I loved about FIRST TENNESSEE staff was that everyone was personable, they knew your name, they made conversation with you about your day, they completed task with precision, and you knew when you walked into the bank you were going to leave with a smile on your face. Now and days there has not only been a name change to First HORIZON, but also a staff change for the worst! Due to covid everyone must use the drive-thru. I went there to request a letter from the bank with my name, address, and account information. The first young lady gave me an employee direct deposit form; I explained to her again what information I was requesting. She called another young lady over to help. The second young lady proceeded to tell me that was the only thing they could give me for direct deposit unless I ordered checks. I then explained again what I needed. Both young ladies continued to tell me that a employee direct deposit form was all I needed. As an unsatisfied customer I requested a branch manager. If the military taught me anything it’s how to patiently wait. I waited another thirteen minutes for a branch supervisor to come to the window and she asked, “How may I help you?” I asked if the other two young ladies explained what I was requesting and she started to tell me the same thing about the form they already gave me. I again explained that I need a LETTER from the BANK with my NAME, ADDRESS, and ACCOUNT information. I let her know that the employee direct deposit form was for someone to fill out themselves and give to their job, and that is not at all what I needed nor requested. After being serviced at the window for a total of forty-three minutes; I was finally given a piece of paper with the information that I was requesting. I was not only disappointed in the time it took for a letter but also in the fact of the staff not listening to what I was requesting.",1,Mississippi,ChIJHVh0jpKJf4gRDbGs0KPZ7II

12/30/2019 22:22:54,Susan Garcia,"I have been a customer for 21 years of First Th - First Horizon.  I have been given the runaround when trying to get access to my funds from my retirement account.   Brie at the bank says that she will give me a call in a couple of hours and then doesn’t call me to give me details on the money that I desperately need.  Then after 2 full business days I am being told that she still hasn’t received a response from the risk department.   When I ask to speak with a manager I was told they are out of the office until Thursday.   Then she just forwards me to customer service.  I was on hold for 10 ministers and after speaking with them was told she put the hold on my money and that cust service could not override the hold.   After being in the phone a half hour we tried to reach back to the Olive Branch bank were Brei is and it was closed at 4 today.  She just forwarded me when I asked what she had not received a response from risk and if she could contact someone in management to get a resolution.

This is not good customer service and I don’t appreciate being poorly handled in this manner.   I deposited a check on Friday 12/27/19 and am being told that I will not have access to my money until 1/9/2020.

So I sent mine and they finally acknowledged that I existed. I told them I needed to cash the check and they charged me $8 to cash a check from one of their own accounts because I myself was not a First Horizon customer.

This is the second mortgage I have financed through First Horizon, and this one was much easier to manage because Justin was on top of everything from the beginning.  He had everything handled with the underwriter, the real estate attorney, and the insurance company with minimal input needed from me.  I would love to work with him again, and I will highly recommend First Horizon mortgage services based off of my experience with Justin.  I have many services through First Horizon, and this experience with Justin was the best.  He never pushed me off onto his assistant (like the wealth management guys do), and he ALWAYS returned my calls, texts, or emails in person. This has not been my experience with First Horizon in the past, and I hope they are turning over a new leaf.  I often get excuses about how busy they are or how they have a new assistant, but with Justin I just got answers and never a single complaint.  I can't say enough about how nice it was to work with a professional who cares about the customer.  Thanks Justin!",5,Mississippi,ChIJ1cHp7ZN-1YcRMufZwO3vzcM

I wanted so long at the drive through that I could have taken a nap, twice. Then the teller asked me how I could be helped......DUHHHHH, look in the tube. I usually go to the branch off of Forest Hill Irene for obvious reasons.......EXCELLENT SERVICE.  I will NEVER come to Kirby again.  I've been Herr three times this month and it's the same below EXCELLENT service.  The teller didn't put my money in the envelope, she stuffed it in there with half of it hanging out.  That's not acceptable. Please train the tellers for more than one day. The one I had the past two times was RUDE, RUDE & RUDE! In order to avoid what's being served at this location I will go to Forest Hill Irene or Germantown.  You all need to take lessons from them",1,Mississippi,ChIJ6STfrLGaf4gRz3QtfAwJPJM

Steer clear of the one that sits at the desk...very passive aggressive, condescending, and rude. When I went back the next day to try to speak with the manager the passive aggressive desk employee had an attitude instead of greeting me (I sat quietly and waited my turn, didnt do any thing but pray that someone ELSE would have helped me).

They said only a drivers license is valid and the manager wouldn’t even close my account without me providing a drivers license instead of passport.

I ask to speak to the manager, who later came from lunch. “Keisha” went to brief the manager before I spoke with her . I spoke with the manager who did nothing in my opinion but pacified me right out the door. Oh Keisha didn’t even show any interest or concern for my problem and me as a customer.  Even though this branch is closer, I drive to the other side of town for customer service , it’s worth the drive.

01/11/2024 16:58:26,William Hawkins,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Maggie Rockett, recommended to me by my local First Horizon, and I must say the experience was nothing short of amazing. When I first approached Maggie, my credit score was not in the ideal range for securing a home loan. However, Maggie's expertise and dedication proved to be invaluable.

From the moment we began the journey towards homeownership, Maggie was with my wife and me every step of the way. Her commitment to improving my credit score was evident, as she meticulously worked with us to address and resolve any issues. Her knowledge of the mortgage process and her ability to navigate the complexities of credit improvement were truly impressive.

What sets Maggie apart is not just her professional competence, but also her genuine concern for her clients. She took the time to understand our unique situation and tailored her approach to meet our specific needs. Her guidance and support made the entire process feel seamless, even for first-time homebuyers like us.

Thanks to Maggie's efforts and expertise, we were able to overcome the credit hurdles and successfully secure our first home. Her proactive communication, attention to detail, and unwavering support made a significant impact on our homebuying journey. I cannot recommend Maggie Rockett highly enough for anyone seeking a dedicated and knowledgeable professional to guide them through the complexities of the mortgage process.",5,Mississippi,ChIJ6bdwCmWEf4gRvc63t3tKDXk

I am a small business owner that had a horrible experience that left me $5500 in the hole because of fraud to my business account. Someone took my check from the post office box erased the intended payee ,wrote in $5500 uploaded to Regions bank Teller machine and First Tennesse cashed it Without checking a signature card! Isn’t the signature card supposed to be for security? Obviously signature cards and security don’t matter at First Horizon Bank. I was told it was past 30 days before I noticed The funds missing, 10 days past the 30 day to be exact. So I was not eligible to be covered for fraudulent activity. Being a business client for over 40 years did not count, having several home loans  plus car loans did not count. I was completely dismissed and told to wait 180 days to find out they would not honor the claim. This fraudulent activity happened in April, I was not notified until December 7. That funds would not be replaced. I went through all the proper procedures of filing paper work, turning it over to Memphis city Police Department, I physically went to Regions bank and found out It was a Account holder of theirs who did the fraudulent activity, and no one could seem to solve the case. Now my small business has taken a hit, I am completely distraught and will never trust this so-called secured bank again!",1,Mississippi,ChIJ7bU9E8-Ef4gRr4wbyfcYOdk

Oh my god, quite possibly the worst company I have ever experienced. They bought out IberiaBank, whom I have had a credit card with for years and they were great to deal with. Unable to use my card to make any purchases outside of the US, I live in Italy. When I try to call to find out if there is a problem, I am put on hold indefinitely. When I call the tech number that pops up in a prompt when my card is not accepted, I get a recording regarding 'something not being programmed yet'. When I set up alerts to my account to notify me when my balance drops or increases, I receive daily erroneous alerts when there is NO activity. When I finally did reach someone a few days ago regarding the alert issue, I was assured I would receive an e-mail either way on the disposition of the problem. Nothing, nada, no follow up.

Extremely unprofessional. Instead of understanding how this could be frustrating to a person they act as if I am an annoyance. I have banked with them since HS which has been well over a decade now.

Highly recommend you go just about anywhere else. 👎",1,North Carolina,ChIJTzYEEYwcU4gRb5suQ-qMR2E
03/25/2020 03:06:46,Andra Brady,"I had experience at this branch on 3-23-20 that is absolutely unthinkable. In 22 years of making and withdrawing commercially,  I have never seen anything close to this. They literally have a magician working at their window. I needed to make a deposit and asked if she  would count the cash because I  knew the approximate amount but not the exact amount.  She said yes. It was a sizable deposit and it was much quicker for her to use the counting machine opposed to me trying to count many sticking bills. This is a action I frequent at my local branch and didn't think it would be a problem considering they're one in the same. She asked if I had I debit  card on me and I said no but I have a doc with the account number on it. I handed her the doc and the cash(all 20's so it should be a simple and rather quick count). After she made at least 3 moves where I could see her and but not the money, then she hands me a deposit slip that is less  than half my approximation. I told her this isn't right. And she, her co-worker and her manager  talked to me  in a condescending way and I've been a commercial customer there for over a decade. Very disrespectful. My dad has banked with this company since it was 1ST NATIONAL BANK and he opened his 1st account with them in the 1950's, just to give some family history with bank.
I discussed this problem with several current and retired  branch managers and tellers and based on their knowledge, anytime there's  a discrepancy with a tellers transaction, their drawer should be closed and counted immediately. The teller must wait for the count to confirm. But that wasn't the case. I was told they would have to watch the tape. I wanted her to count the money 1st before the deposit and her manager told me that ""wasn't her job"". Terrible customer service.
I advise anyone that deals with this location to check your withdrawals and deposits 3 times. And if you ever got home and thought your money was short, you were probably right. And if I could leave a 0 rating I would 3X that vote.",1,North Carolina,ChIJTzYEEYwcU4gRb5suQ-qMR2E

Service here has taken a rapid downhill turn since becoming Capital Bank. Robin and her team are extremely unresponsive and they’ve made major mistakes with deposits on my account. I truly want to change banks but moving 3 accounts with half a dozen merchants/integrations is not easy. Hopefully 2020 I’ll be elsewhere.

When I went inside to see about getting help or another way to pull out money I was offered NO solution. They literally helped direct me to another First Horizon another 20 minutes away. The error wasn’t my card. The error was the ATM wasn’t working. At first this location (downtown) assumed it was my card (what’s the saying about assuming…). Not very friendly tellers either. Just no help or troubleshooting for a simple problem. They could have helped me inside (I found out after I drove 20 minutes to the other location).

It is mostly the staff at this branch since Falls of The Neuse and Wake Forest go above and beyond being helpful to turn around major banking mistakes the Six Forks Branch keeps making.   I was advised to call the regional manager but never got a return call from him so that's a real sign that my business is unimportant to this establishment.   I'm desperately seeking to move my accounts but picking up and moving 4 major accounts is a task that will require some time and research since I want to stay at the next bank I choose.",1,North Carolina,ChIJU8fP1_5XrIkRisIU3vlTtj0

That's about the only good thing about banking at First Horizon.  Their communication is below average.  All my transactions are slow to post to my account.  Chad the bank manager is a liar and told me things just so he would not have to deal with my complaints.  I will be closing my account just as soon as a 7 day hold is lifted.  I was unaware of the hold but had no choice but to deposit it there because that's where i bank.  Take your money to union bank or state employee credit union or hell even truist gotta be better than this place.  They were a whole different bank when they were capital bank or first Tennessee.  First horizon is a headache all day long.,1,North Carolina,ChIJ-0UvrbemrYkR_47vQaYsvvY

If we (my company) don't come for the day or even week when we're scheduled to, they are entitled to complain. However, just because me or my colleagues don't come precisely when they want us to at their beck and call doesn't mean there's some issue or that we're fooling around picking our noses, or that we can be patronized in such a manner.

I have a builder who has a history of cashing bad checks and banks with this bank. I always have gone and turned the check in to a bank check to guarantee funds. Yesterday I get told because I am not an account holder I will no longer be able to do this. Why??? I ask the tell she states she just got informed this month of bank policy. Well I still don't understand so I ask to review the policy. Her response was your not a customer so we cant give it! Well I say that makes no sense and then I say if I open an account may I then have a copy?? She replies to me no it in employee information only! Well so now to take her word for it and still not have them honor there check to our business I am to say the least frustrated. So I am forced to open an account to avoid the long waiting of the check that may bounce if I just deposit it into my accounts take 2 weeks builder incurs 8 to 10,000 more in debit with me and the bank has no policy to show for it!  Well I am loosing my mind here on trying to understand this. So Now I have an account still no policy of on the matter call to get answered and be told that they might return my call after review of my complaint. She stated taking my complaint that I have requested to be contacted well YES !!! I strongly urge you to choose another bank to do business with! I have several bank relationships and never in 15 years of good business habits ever dealt with a bank to big to remember why they are in business to begin with. Its a sad day when you get a check and cant get it honored or funds secured due to Policy issues that are not even properly supported.",1,North Carolina,ChIJZyYAwhanrIkRHL3xyobslAA

I've been a customer since 2010, and have established wonderful relationships with the people at the  25th St NW and the Keith Street branch, in Cleveland, TN. Specifically, I'd like to give a shout out for Carolyne, Samantha, Lisa, and Kelly!! They have truly been a Blessing to me and my family, and many of our staff members in our business. They are professional and they know what they are doing. The entire team at both of these branches do!  Whether going into the branch or the drive through, it's amazing how many people are all greeted by name, even before they present their deposit/banking information.  I've seen customers bring them flowers, Frosty's and all kinds of treats.  They're all genuinely Loved.  I would also like to add that the same professionalism, knowledge, and kindness have been shown by other team members across the board, whether it be calling the 800 numbers with inquiries about a lost card, on-line technical support, or general questions, I have never had a negative experience.  In my 50+ years of banking, I can honestly say that First Horizon Bank has been the best!",5,Ohio,ChIJJ3Wf4fErXogRXpJ-QqYb0cg

This is the second mortgage I have financed through First Horizon, and this one was much easier to manage because Justin was on top of everything from the beginning.  He had everything handled with the underwriter, the real estate attorney, and the insurance company with minimal input needed from me.  I would love to work with him again, and I will highly recommend First Horizon mortgage services based off of my experience with Justin.  I have many services through First Horizon, and this experience with Justin was the best.  He never pushed me off onto his assistant (like the wealth management guys do), and he ALWAYS returned my calls, texts, or emails in person. This has not been my experience with First Horizon in the past, and I hope they are turning over a new leaf.  I often get excuses about how busy they are or how they have a new assistant, but with Justin I just got answers and never a single complaint.  I can't say enough about how nice it was to work with a professional who cares about the customer.  Thanks Justin!",5,Ohio,ChIJ1cHp7ZN-1YcRMufZwO3vzcM

Tellers were rude and didn't know what they were talking about, ATM's everywhere would eat my debit card for no reason, transfers would get lost in their computer system, and so and so on.   Bigger doesn't always mean better and in this case it's definitely not better.  I closed all my accounts with them sometime ago but my Mom still uses them although she too has had multiple problems with them since their switch.  My aunt as well.  So use with caution!

They looked out for the guards as much as the guards looked out for them. Anytime there was a special event, or birthday going on, you knew without a doubt that they were going to go all out. The ladies there were extremely sweet, friendly, and just straight up funny/hilarious at times. Kristi, Allison, Tammy, amd April. I'm going to miss working alongside you as your guard.

Tried to get simple change and they told me I couldn't get change unless I was a commercial account. All they want to do is charge for every little transaction. With a great credit score and being a long term customer they wouldn't even help me with a loan. Well excuse me. They offered me a loan as long as I had 30% down. And would then only loan 60% of the total cost. What a joke. After choosing to close my account, they didn't even close it the day they said they would afterimage had been told it would be closed. They then added 7$ charges monthly without my knowledge to this ""closed"" account. They then sent me to collections which is attacking my credit now. What a joke. Never an appology. Never once were willing to make it right. Even after admitting they should have closed the account. They just ""forgot"" on a Friday. The account manager said "" I was in hurry to leave on Friday and forgot."" Wow! And I have to suffer. Never once did they offer to make this right. Told me to go to collections. Omg.

10/12/2019 16:45:25,Robert Davidson (Mr. Jones),"I LOVE this bank. I have several business and personal accounts with them.  I opened an account with Capital Bank on the very first day they were open for business.  I even bought some of their stock bc they’re a local startup and I feel it’s important to support local businesses.

I’ve watched them grow over the years. ..And boy have they Grown?!!
They have grown into a large Nationally sized bank in presence (branches) and in assets & deposits.  They’ve done this through some very smart & strategic buyouts and corporate mergers.

One of the best parts of this banks story, in my opinion, is that even though they’ve grown, they haven’t lost their local “feel”.  You know, that personal touch. They still have that small hometown bank vibe.  The folks there know me by name when I walk in. That’s huge to me.  That’s character, and it’s something that can’t be bought.  You either have it or you wish you did.
They have it.
My advice, go in and check them out. Tell them Rob Sent you!",5,Ohio,ChIJtbHMfIv1rIkRojWBx1bXev0

In June 2021 after several months and numerous requests to get a paper copy of our bank statement &  credit card mailed to our company we terminated our accounts and moved our corporate banking relationship to First Citizens. 16 months after closing our accounts I received a phone call from First Horizon collections. Apparently they didn't close our corporate credit card account and an automated subscription renewal of $99 hit the account in FEB 2022. At no time in the period between FEB & OCT 2022 did we receive either an emailed or mailed statement and no one from First Horizons called us. Frankly, I don't know how this bank stays in business.

However, the manager went on to tell me that they wouldn't give me any of these coins even if I did have an account because it was (somehow) too much trouble, and after being asked why I wanted them, she said they didn't want to get ""involved"" with me possibly making a profit from finding silver coins.

When I walked into the bank I was greeted with a very warm welcome from Kelley and her staff. They all were warm, welcoming and friendly. I was able to open up a checking account AND received my ATM/VISA DEBIT CARD on the spot! It only took about 15 minutes and I was all set! Thank you very much! I am super satisfied and as Kelley would say: ""ROGER THAT!"". If you are tired of talking to a computer on the phone and want a live, friendly, helpful person to help you, then go to First Horizon Bank and tell them that StressFreeJP sent you!

My daughter recently started her first job and needed an account for direct deposit. We arrived shortly after 3pm.  We were immediately acknowledged by staff and directed to a desk that would be able to handle our request. A very personable member of the team, that was actually headed out for another engagement, and quite dapperly dressed I might add, offered water and showed us to some nice comfy chairs where we could wait.  When this same team member realized that it would be more than a few minutes before we would be helped, he came over to retrieve us to handle our request instead.  Guys, he was the Vice President!!!  Nicholas Collins far exceeded my expectations.  He purposefully and smoothly conversed with my daughter and told her how awesome it was for her to have her first job and commended on her intentions to save her money. I couldn't be more proud of my community!!!  Thank you Mr. Collins and First Horizon Bank of Hendersonville, you truly put your customers first!",5,Ohio,ChIJ8QUh1dJGZIgRpVYgToJZW7I

I ask to speak to the manager, who later came from lunch. “Keisha” went to brief the manager before I spoke with her . I spoke with the manager who did nothing in my opinion but pacified me right out the door. Oh Keisha didn’t even show any interest or concern for my problem and me as a customer.

I really appreciate the spots in the parking garage reserved for First Horizon as they provide quick access to the building. They validate parking and have actually reminded me of this on one occasion where I forgot to ask. It is somewhat hard to find if you are not familiar with downtown Columbia, but that was easily solved with a quick phone call when I got lost trying to find it on my first visit after moving here from TN. It is also fair to point out that this location is immaculate inside. Everything is clean and dust free. It always smells like a home rather than a business. The staff always dress sharp but not too formal. It really is an ideal experience.

02/04/2019 19:28:19,Keith Craig,"Since being acquired by First Horizon/First Tennessee Bank, Capital Bank has sadly failed to live up to all the pre-merger hype. The most disappointing factor is the total failure of the bank to fix the horrible problems with their online banking app which is pretty much useless (see all the 1-star reviews in the Apple store). I have NEVER been able to use the check deposit feature successfully, and now even the simple account maintenance functions are hit-and-miss. There's simply too much aggressive competition in the retail banking sector to stay with a company that can't even get the fundamentals right so instead of fighting the Pelham Road traffic to do something as prehistoric as depositing a check in person at the only branch in the upstate, I'm closing my account and letting everyone know why!",1,South Carolina,ChIJC_Zdd2spWIgR1QA-_0mThAc

No, I'm not a TD Bank troll - I'm a genuine (now former) Capital Bank customer who stayed loyal during the takeover, but then was rewarded for my loyalty by a website that lacked some really basic functionality, and a mobile app that rates a very generous (IMHO) 1.5 stars on both the iOS and Android platforms!

The app works great, the website works great. They are friendly and very very helpful. I do not plan on switching banks.

We highly recommend this bank..  All the tellers are nice, caring and do a great  job.. They always take good care of all the customers in a very timely manner..
We've dealt with all of them Wendy, Amy, Lori, Tess, Beth and the manager Rich... I have never had any problems here... I feel they're in my best interest to watch after my  money..💰💰💰
Furthermore, we have a safety deposit box.. We have maintained this box for years here..  It is cheap enough to make it worth it and they let me access it absolutely anytime we want or need to 😀 during their banking hours....
In conclusion we highly recommended and first-rate good job for this crew... 😁",5,South Carolina,ChIJFT4hjEpxV4gRoPGm6JEfUPM

I needed to pull out funds from my CAD account but the ATM outside said the ATM was temporarily unavailable. When I went inside to see about getting help or another way to pull out money I was offered NO solution. They literally helped direct me to another First Horizon another 20 minutes away. The error wasn’t my card. The error was the ATM wasn’t working. At first this location (downtown) assumed it was my card (what’s the saying about assuming…). Not very friendly tellers either. Just no help or troubleshooting for a simple problem. They could have helped me inside (I found out after I drove 20 minutes to the other location).

She was smart enough not get directly behind me, cuz she knew it would have caused a problem. And then stares at me as I walk towards the door and out of it.

11/20/2023 16:33:11,Kandis Williams,"Just left this bank about 20mins ago…..

I normally have great relationships with banks, but my review is based on THIS location, not First Horizon but my experience with this location. Basically I received a high value check, I deposited the check at my own bank(Not first horizon) due to the deposit being on a Friday of course it’s going to take some days but my bank stated in order to lift the hold the “cleared” portion had to be done by this bank. I went to the teller, was speaking with a nice representative, as I’m asking her to let me know how long before my check clears(shows a copy of their check), she pulls up the account. She says, the funds are there but it hasn’t cleared it may clear tonight . As I proceed to ask more questions about my personal check I received, an African American older lady and a white older lady begins chiming in the conversation yelling, “We can’t give this information; this is private” Yelling at the top of their lungs! I’m looking at the two women like how dare you all enter into a conversation not concerning you and no personal information was being asked! I specifically was asking about MY personal check because I didn’t want a bounce in MY account. The level of professionalism is just absurd. I don’t know if they were doing it to try and embarrass me or what the issue was but it was very very rude and something needs to be done about this location. It’s ridiculous! The customers behind me was just staring ..because they were trying to pretty much imply I was trying to receive  personal banking information when I just wanted a verification of the personal check I received. I’m a wealthy individual and for that FIRST HORIZON ON TRINITY WILL NEVER RECEIVE MY BUSINESS!",1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I
12/14/2023 08:35:48,Chris,I don’t bank here but only went in for a check I got and the old white lady with the cross around her neck was rude. I came really close to saying something to her at the time this happened. Luckily I don’t bank here and never would after that.,1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I

02/09/2022 19:51:58,Glynnis Cox,This drive through location is very slow. Arrived at 1:26 which might still be the lunch hour.  There were 3 cars in each lane totaling 9 cars. After waiting 10 minutes with no movement at all 4 of the cars backed out and choose not to wait.  The teller was nice when it was my turn but it was still slow.  Pulled out at 1:48. 22 minutes in the drive thru lane.,3,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I
02/26/2022 18:07:38,Mackenzie Rader,"Branch manager either doesn’t understand certain things or just doesnt care. I shouldn’t have to explain the same thing multiple times, or ask the same question multiple times to get a direct answer. After the merge from first Tennessee, I’ve seen a decline in customer service. I’ve dealt with it. But after this, I’m going to a different bank. The branch manager gets a very condescending attitude because she didn’t want to answer a question I guess. The associate I spoke to before her, was way more knowledgeable and actually understood what I was saying. I’ve also noticed inconsistent information on specific policies and even the branch manager couldn’t explain them to me.",1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I

I told her I am a First Tennessee Banker and asked if this branch had any Safe Deposit Boxes. She answer all my questions and sounded very Courteous and Positive. I felt very comfortable speaking with her. Although this was over the phone, it may be a different experience in person.

They said my personal checking and small business account would be able to quick transfer, but that is absolutely not true. On top of that when I deposited into my business account, they put it into my personal checking. It’s the weekend and these circumstances have caused me a great deal of stress. It’s only my first week of banking here and I already can’t wait to close my account. See you Monday first horrible- I mean horizon. and then never again",1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I

10/31/2020 14:15:00,jonathan oats,I waited in line for 30 minutes in the cold only to be told once I reached the counter that I had to go through drive thru since I didnt have an account with them. I was simply cashing a check and the person who issued it had an account. When I got in the drive thru line it took me another 45 minutes to reach the window. This place was very rude to the people in line and very slow.,1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I
12/01/2017 20:45:48,Beat Buzz Memphis,"The first thing I should say is that I am not a First Tennessee banker and do not have an account at this establishment. I had received a check from my employer in which First Tennessee Bank is the bank through which it's drawn. I went to cash my check and knew that I most likely would have to go inside to cash it, as most banks now utilize their drive through strictly for account holders (a service that should be open to everyone, but I digress). At any rate, I had my 5 month old and my 2 year old in tow and had just gotten diagnosed with the flu not even an hour before. I went to the drive through hoping that if I told them my predicament that they would allow me to simply cash the check without having to drag my children out of the vehicle and into their establishment, allowing me to conserve some energy while simultaneously preserving their entire office from exposure to the dreaded flu virus. Seems logical, right? Well logic seems to evade the associates at this particular FTB location because I was made to come inside, hacking away, sick as a dog. So if the flu ravages its employees sometime in the near future, you can blame ""policy"" as I tried to spare all of them. There are some common courtesies that should remain all-inclusive to every human being, not just your customers and I would NEVER bank where ""policy"" overrides humanity.",1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I

08/20/2015 20:28:45,Khaled Hamadeh,"Horrible location. Each and every time I try to make a deposit on this location the bank manager tries to put a hold on my account. This is very inconvenient and I do not experience this treatment anywhere except for this location.When I have voiced my concerns, I was told that it is up to the bank manager's ""discretion"" which let's me know that the bank manager is singling me out. Perhaps because of my foreign name. I make deposits with no problems at all other locations.",1,Tennessee,ChIJq_9jkGycf4gR_t4_uplKj2I

It seems they don't have enough staff or the staff they do have don't have a clue what speed and efficiency is. As a bank they're fine but as a specific branch they need better management or the ability to hire more staff. No one should have to wait more than a few minutes on a deposit.

Because of a friends recommendation we visited FTB and have been elated with their service but even more so with their employees. Marcus Haley has been taking wonderful care of us for many years now and is the best banking representative we have had the pleasure of working with. His big smile and positive attitude makes banking easy and enjoyable.

Jennifer Byrd in financial services is equally good.

06/13/2022 17:24:20,Dorothy Smith,"This is the absolute worse bank we’ve ever dealt with, on the 18th of May $3000 was fraudulently taken out of my husbands account, the original Representative informed him that it was their fault and he needed to cancel his old account and open a new account which he did, he’s spoken with 5 different people to get his money back and he’s been getting the run around. It’s time to get a lawyer! It’s not their money so they don’t care, as soon as this is resolved he’s changing banks. First Horizon Bank is the worst bank, I’ll keep my money under my mattress before I bank with them.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ5znWcA-Ef4gR7GLgk6T0rQ4

People who get off work at 4pm-5pm-6pm have no chance to making it to their own bank because it’s already closed by 4pm and doesn’t open until Monday 8AM, what the hell? I’m about to close my account and take my business else where! Terrible..",1,Tennessee,ChIJ5znWcA-Ef4gR7GLgk6T0rQ4

1) my account had been hacked for 6 months consistently.
2) my nephew was physically assaulted trying to cash a business check at the Smyrna Tennessee branch. Which in my opinion did not get handled in an appropriate fashion when brought the attention of the company.
3) I continuously got calls from the bank regarding ""certain"" staff members cashing business checks under $100.
Finally I closed my account in 2023 because no notifications were flagged on my account. I would not suggest the company as a whole.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ24RMo8H3Y4gRiCyvqCn4O4E

However, Natasha is who leads me to this review. I don't know her title, but she is on a serious power trip and needs a reality check. Because I questioned her answer, she cut me off, told me I wasn't listening, and hung up on me. I called back and asked to speak to someone else and she told me I was rude and hung up on me again. I never raised my voice, never cussed - just asked her my question again because her answer the first time made it seem like she didnt understand what I was actually asking and she took major offense to it. Anyway, finally after calling back again, I got a super sweet girl named Olivia who took time to go over my questions with me. But Natasha's behavior just put the icing on the cake and it's time to be done with this bank.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ24RMo8H3Y4gRiCyvqCn4O4E
08/18/2023 15:40:37,Carl,"Bank Customer here for about 10yrs. Went in to cash less than $100 in rolled coin. The teller told me they wouldn't cash it in because it would have to be sent to the central office, counted, and then it would be deposited in my account. I asked the teller and another person there why, and they said all coin Corp wide is treated this way for some time now. I then asked for the branch managers card, and they said they didn't have a manager. I then called the 1-800 number, and they confirmed this is NOT the corp policy. This is a discretionary decision incases of too much to count or not enough time to process at the branch. So, they essentially LIED and turned a customer away.

On the other hand, the branch on 808 S Church Street was welcoming, helpful, and very pleasant from the moment I entered to the moment I left the building.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ24RMo8H3Y4gRiCyvqCn4O4E

She texted while we were meeting ( for only 10 minutes), couldn't describe interest to me ... (I know what it is but I wanted more detail on what that meant for my account specifically). And so much more. The staff is nice but I'm genuinely frustrated with how so much yet nothing has been done.

Edit: they finally got my account set up. However, now I can't log into my account on the app or online to check my balance. Very frustrating. Worst bank ever.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ24RMo8H3Y4gRiCyvqCn4O4E

One of them, a lady, continued typing and never looked up, and the other, a young man whom I was sitting directly across from, sipped his coffee then got up then sipped his coffee again and walked across the room to do something minor. Then he sat down started typing and then sipped his coffee, then got up again then guessed what I needed and I said ok. Then he walked across the room again to do something very minor again. Then asked me over to his desk I told him what I needed then he got up to do it and he sat down at someone else's desk and started talking something about that could have waited, but instead I waited over and over and over again. Then finally got up walked across the room grabbed the what I needed then handed to me. I promise I don't think the world of myself, I'm not a narcissist, but they could have treated me better, if only a little bit. It kind of hurt my feelings.

I’ve had the same bank account for over 15 years even though the bank has changed names over the years. I recently opened a business checking account this year, and everyone who has helped me at First Horizon has been amazing. BUT David Bradley has been exceptional to work with. He’s really created a relationship with me and my business. He’s creating authentic relationships in the banking world with the small businesses that do business with First Horizon Bank. I’m grateful to share my story and journey with him. He’s looked out for me and recommended some great opportunities that the bank has to offer. Because of that, my business is getting local exposure, networking abilities with other small business, and supporting great causes like Habitat for Humanity.
Never before have I had a genuine, authentic, empathetic relationship with something who works at my local bank. This restores my faith in humanity to treat humans like people with feelings.

07/29/2022 02:28:24,Jon Farr,"There isn’t a option low enough to rate this specific branch of this bank. The manager now and previous manager are both grade a tools. First Horizon has many branches that I’d rate 5 star! I truly hope this review helps steer existing and new accounts from this place and saves them the stress and abuse that First Horizon boldly promotes within and even worse rewards branch managers via commission for basically stealing from existing and loyal account holders. This review will be viewed by the bank and labeled as a disgruntled customer but feel free to chase my history in reviews for this bank and ask yourself how many disgruntled customers stayed and willingly accepted the type of abuse first horizon consistently steals from
It’s customers with. My accounts are business accounts and are 10+ years old. The bank provides a merchant service to clients that excuses fraudulent activity within its security parameters then penalizes the customer for that fraud they allowed to occur. Hand in hand with this pathetic bank both then begin stealing from the customer by penalizing and charging fees. In 3 months time the account manager at the Nashville branch on woodland street had stolen well over $7500 doing exactly as described above. The merchant service has stolen over $3k in that same window. Both acknowledged and confirmed the fraud then willingly began taken their share of the money. Currently I have alerted the OCC and the Federal Trade Commision. I have also contacted a class action attorney specific to this type criminal activity. I will make this info available to any potential customer that foolishly considers first horizon as a bank of choice. Run as fast as possible from this bank. Tell everyone  you can to do the same also. This place should be shut down by the fed and hopefully will face heavy fines and this branch manager will be working at a gas station soon. He deserves much much worse but I’d settle to see him working a toilet wand at the shell station after losing everything he stole. This guy is the definition of POS!!!!

04/04/2022 17:30:17,Felicia Smith,not understanding the negative review here.. I did however leave a negative one for the 3518 Gallatin Pike location today... I run a business and come to the Woodland Street location daily unless I have an important corporate call or unless it is Saturday ( I wish you guys would be open on Saturdays FYI) You guys are so so fast.. I wish you could train some of the Gallatin pike people because it always takes me atleast 20 minutes for a simple deposit and change which is unacceptable... Kudos to you guys and ESPECIALLY KELLY !! She is awesome always and even brought me out my change order to the line one day with a smile .. thank you so so much !!,5,Tennessee,ChIJaWuBX81nZIgRAGAgyMiUXvI
07/13/2019 06:58:16,Karlos Coleman,"Never in my life have I ever felt so racially profiled at my own bank.
I came into this branch on 07/12/2019, around 4 o’clock.
I have been having problems with my account and changes out of nowhere, so I am finally fed up with it and decided to withdraw all of my money out of my account. The staff is very unprofessional, you have some employees on Bluetooth headsets taking personal calls, some employees even talking out loud from one side of the bank to the other. Back to the Incident that took place, I went into the bank to take all of my money out, so the employees that was assisting me was very unprofessional, I first attempted to withdraw my money from the Drive-through but the amount I was requesting was a bit high so I had to go in. The entire time of me making my With drawl the staff made me feel like I was committing a crime to my own back account, it took the representative over 7 minutes to verify my account, which was an excuse to stall while her and another young black bald gentleman made calls to make sure my account was in good standing/ making sure I didn’t have anything pending on my account, these two were literally texting back and forth with each other - this made me feel so very uneasy and profiled. Finally I was finally able to get all of my money out of my account after 10 minutes, the Representative did not count my money back to me and did not offer a envelope for 3,000 plus dollars... For that I will no longer be doing business with First Tennessee Bank and I will be taking this matter to Headquarters to make sure no one else has to go through that kind of experience.",1,Tennessee,ChIJaWuBX81nZIgRAGAgyMiUXvI

Let’s say you don’t have money that week, and your checking account gets a charge. The bank WON’T pay it, but they will charge you a $30 dollar fee every single time it is charged. You’ll end up owing 1-3 hundred to them. Go with any other bank that doesn’t use such vial methods to gain capital.
Thank you.",1,Tennessee,ChIJaWuBX81nZIgRAGAgyMiUXvI

After being told to wait on the couch, waited for 30 minutes and they instead took someone else that walked in the door. Walked out at that point. This is the second time this has happened, not sure if I look poor or what, but damn. I can put money in easily but cant even use my debit card because the chip doesn’t work, yet again.

This is my second time actually going inside of bank and the manager interrupted the teller at the desk to ask me where I did my money come from like you can not clearly look at my direct deposit. Then said is it your taxes like it’s any of his business right after he took my ID with him. Everything is legit with my income I work hard! Then there’s a Caucasian older women from my first experience who sits in the booth on the left who has the nastiest attitude I honestly thinks she hates her job never get her assistance if someone else is available.

Everytime I come here it always takes me atleast 20+ minutes . Today was no different . I arrived 2 minutes after opening and there was a gentleman that was already there . I had a simple deposit and change order.. I finally left over 20 minutes later.. SERIOSULY you guys need some more intense training if this is acceptable. Unfortunately I am forced to have to come here  Saturdays since Woodland Street is closed then.. I know this review probably won't matter and I usually forego leaving reviews but I wish something would be done.

01/05/2022 16:02:17,Ray Lee,"Yesterday, 01/04/22, I went to this branch to try and exchange ROLLED coins for the SAME AMOUNT of rolled coins. My daughter and I like to search through rolls for older coins. I was standing in line, waiting patiently, when Jeremy came up to me and asked what I needed. I explained that I was here to see if I can exchange rolls for rolls of the same denomination if they had any that weren’t brand new. At first, he looked at the teller and back to me and said he didn’t think they could do that. Then said there was some policy about them having to send the rolls to Nashville to be broken open. He didn’t even ask anyone else if they could do that. I immediately got the sense that he just didn’t want to even help. I’ve been going to other First Tenn and First Horizon banks in the area(from Murfreesboro, Nolensville, Lebanon, and others in Franklin) and there hasn’t been one issue at all. Yesterday matter of fact, I exchanged a few rolls at First Horizon in Nolensville and Chase in Franklin and they were very willing to exchange for what they had. It’s not like I’m coming in and buying all the coins. I only exchange for the amount of rolls that I have. I’ve been a First Tennessee customer all my life. The poor customer service from Jeremy is another reason I am thinking of switching to Chase. Definitely not returning to this branch. I would like an explanation from a manager who know what they are doing and if there is actually a policy and how I can’t exchange rolls for rolls. I take the time to roll them back up for the bank tellers to create less work for them.",1,Tennessee,ChIJJxyeOP17ZIgRakbsXsO1-w8

01/04/2023 20:57:16,Karrington Christian,"Called and spoke with James on the phone to inquire about opening a business line of credit. During our brief conversation I specifically asked him if I needed an appointment as I know things like that can be a rather extensive process. He replied “no, just come on in and Maria or Jaime can get you taken care of!” So I drove in, on my off day to see about getting it taken care of. Upon my arrival I walked up to James’s desk and let him know I had just spoken with him on the phone and reiterated what I was needing to do. AGAIN, he tells me Maria (sitting 3 feet away from him) could do it and to take a seat and she would be with us. 20 minutes later Maria walks over and asks me what I’m looking to do, as if she didn’t just hear me tell James who was standing 3 feet away from her I was looking to open a business line of credit. She then proceeded to tell me she couldn’t do that and that her manager was the only one who could do it, she was on lunch (at 1:30 in the afternoon) and that we would need to make a appointment. Meanwhile James, still standing where he was before completely neglects to say ANYTHING AT ALL, issue any form of apology or offer any form of solution. Instead he stood there silently, disregarding the situation as though he had suddenly suffered acute hearing loss.

01/11/2024 16:58:26,William Hawkins,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Maggie Rockett, recommended to me by my local First Horizon, and I must say the experience was nothing short of amazing. When I first approached Maggie, my credit score was not in the ideal range for securing a home loan. However, Maggie's expertise and dedication proved to be invaluable.

From the moment we began the journey towards homeownership, Maggie was with my wife and me every step of the way. Her commitment to improving my credit score was evident, as she meticulously worked with us to address and resolve any issues. Her knowledge of the mortgage process and her ability to navigate the complexities of credit improvement were truly impressive.

What sets Maggie apart is not just her professional competence, but also her genuine concern for her clients. She took the time to understand our unique situation and tailored her approach to meet our specific needs. Her guidance and support made the entire process feel seamless, even for first-time homebuyers like us.

Thanks to Maggie's efforts and expertise, we were able to overcome the credit hurdles and successfully secure our first home. Her proactive communication, attention to detail, and unwavering support made a significant impact on our homebuying journey. I cannot recommend Maggie Rockett highly enough for anyone seeking a dedicated and knowledgeable professional to guide them through the complexities of the mortgage process.",5,Tennessee,ChIJ6bdwCmWEf4gRvc63t3tKDXk

I created my account online on First Horizon’s website after calling this location to make sure I can deposit cash at ATMs on weekends and that I can deposit checks through their mobile app since I work for a local business and only receive hand written paper checks.
After creating my account and receiving a log in emailed to me I realized their app doesn’t work AT ALL! I couldn’t log in and their website said my account didn’t exist 😑 I check the App Store reviews and they literally have 1 star! I immediately uninstalled and called to close my account and was told I have to wait until my debit card comes in the mail to close my account.
I waited and the day my card comes (Monday, July 31st) I activate it then spent all the money I had on my card so I wouldn’t have to wait for a check to be mailed to me. I called customer service once more to close my account and this time I’m told I HAVE TO go in person to close my account. Then he tells me I have an “incoming deposit” and I can’t close my account until Thursday. At this point I’m just offended at the pure incompetence because HOW do I have a deposit incoming when I’ve made ONE singular deposit to open the account….then already spent that money?
I opened my account online as someone without a car and I refuse to walk from home in this 100 degree weather JUST to close a bank account.
Today is Friday Aug 4th and I was able to close my account over the phone by calling a different First Horizon Bank location and asking them to connect me to customer service.

04/15/2023 10:58:18,Mazen Lawand,"I cannot imagine the experience being as good as it was had it not been for Mike Dickstein. Mike is THE reason we decided to proceed with purchasing a home and becoming a First Horizon customer.

As a first time home buyer, the process was extremely overwhelming. Mike managed to guide us throughout the process with complete ease, making the lending process underwhelming! In every step, Mike proved to be knowledgeable, honest, professional, friendly, patient, diligent, and consistently available to me (even at times I did not expect)!

We would not be a First Horizon customer if It were not for Mike. We plan to increase banking activities with First Horizon, and we will definitely be back for future financing needs.

Thank you Mike. I don't know what we would have done without your excellent counseling and support. Keep up the great work!",5,Texas,ChIJ7_YqCUWeToYRg-GF5PuBGnk

He delivers in spades not only with respect to lending/underwriting but he also communicates excellently and he always knows how to triage the important from the non-critical, thereby yielding as pain free and smooth an experience as possible.  He has your back every step of the way and even expertly guides his mortgagee clients through other aspects of the real estate contracting and closing process that lie beyond the financing/underwriting wheelhouse.

The online banking system barely functions and you are unable to log in to the system majority of the time. After the update it still barely functions. I work in technology and this is the worst banking service portal I've used in the United States.

When I call the bank to get statements to do my year end accounting - they want to charge me $5.00 a statement...WHAT?

Also, forget about doing any sort of International Wire Transfers and the lovely service fee charges that randomly pop up on your account.

Do yourself a favor and bank anywhere else - your wallet and emotional state will be in a much better place.

Notwithstanding an appointment scheduled by a teller [who was in the lunch room], 15 minutes past the time she scheduled, a mistake was made by Iberia Bank regarding its own procedures [admitted to by the manager].

Essentially all Iberia Bank personnel, were simply unsympathetic to our circumstances, but more importantly, unprofessional to the extent that the customer experienced a hardship created by Iberia Bank.

Additionally, a legal representative was suppose to contact us [the client] and discuss our concerns but instead contacted the supervising manager who stone walled us to the point of complete frustration.

01/28/2021 17:42:23,Claude Robertson (J-Rod’s Sports Card),Horrible bank from the #800 to the employees at the local bank. Make false claims on helping people during the pandemic and when you ask the to fix a mistake on your account they tell me maybe you should get a credit card and get overdraft protection.  When I said o was going to find another bank said they didn't care . T,1,West Virginia,ChIJ2QHhIM9BTYgRa15dzd2kiz0

03/13/2021 11:50:38,E S,"Replaced card twice since the conversion, due to malfunctions. The txt and email alerts regarding your account balance is never accurate and I could go on and on....SunTrust was on point with customer service and ensuring your balance update was accurate up to the min. Easy digital banking and making deposits. Everything was easier for the customer. Will be looking for another bank!!!",1,West Virginia,ChIJfwEBWACbUogRSXrQKKgTUfk
01/10/2022 08:48:41,Mike Brown,"The exact same female that worked at Sun Trust in Krogers was always rude to customers, Then once the name changed to First Horizon all of a sudden there goes the rude black girl that  Wells Fargo in Bassett Virginia working gets rid of due to her being rude there working in First Horizon. The young smart lip service black female and now she is running around in First Horizon Bank as if she is the head big wheel that owns the bank and being very rude to customers, rolling her eyes, and sucking her lips as the customers are major problems to her and she shouldn't have any job dealing with the public at all. She is a major reason that bank is so awful!!! She even have the nerve to try to impress the other girls that work in First Horizon Bank by being so rude and talking down on customers!!! The best option is to close the bank down and let another business be there!!!",1,West Virginia,ChIJfwEBWACbUogRSXrQKKgTUfk
