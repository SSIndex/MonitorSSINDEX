08/23/2021 17:14:40,Fillip Nelson,"I'm am not sure to blame this situation on the bank M&T itself for lack of training, or if this is something that falls on the branch.

I went in the branch on Wednesday, August 19, 2021 to initiate a wire transfer. I went up to the teller and she told me I have to schedule that service.

She told me the person that does the wire transfer is not in at the moment, and she was at that point going to let me walk out the door.

Before leaving, I  turned back around to re-approach the teller and asked, ""ok, well how can I schedule a transfer""? She gave me a sticky note to write down my name and phone number, and said she will try her best to get one scheduled for today.  The tone was very nonchalant to the point that it just made the statement unbelieve or that she could care less.

The wire was needed to close on a home.

After I got home, I waited for about one hour and sided with my intuition that no one was going to call me back and instead went to my other bank Chase on MLK to Initiate a wire which took about 15 minutes.

It is now the 23rd and I have yet to get a call back.

I am so glad I did not chose them as a lender to close on the home. It could have been disastrous.

I think at this point I will pull my funds from M&T bank and transfer to Chase, the customer service, lack of staff, and lack of concern at this branch is alarming. I would suggest the current employees be retrained.",1,Alabama,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU
04/21/2017 19:18:04,Kevin Yea,"A terrible place to do banking.  I went into to do a wire and I had to wait more than an hour because the branch is disorganized and they don't even bother checking on you if the wait is long.  The staff isn't adequately trained either.  This is really the responsibility of the bank at large and its regional manager.   It's ran so poorly I'm embarassed to admit that I bank here.  This place needs a real improvement in terms of staffing, training, staff etiquette, etc.",1,Alabama,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU
04/27/2017 23:10:07,Racquel ‚ÄúScrumptuosity‚Äù Hill,Used to bank here. Every time you go in the branch there are only two tellers. Even on Fridays! I closed my account with them 4 years ago and they are harassing me with a collection department for $50 only because they know that after 5 years it'll be erased. Good luck!,1,Alabama,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU

02/11/2020 02:16:12,Alisia W,I‚Äôve banked here since I moved to PA (5 years) and almost always use this branch exclusively. Today I came to withdraw the money to pay my rent and when I got the the counter and said I needed to make a withdrawal the teller looked me dead in my face and said ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you use the ATM?‚Äù I was shocked and managed to choke out I need to withdraw over $1000 and she informed me that you can now pull that much out of it. Glad I learned that but I could have done without the attitude! Definitely makes me think about switching banks!,2,Arkansas,ChIJAaCpYCWMyIkRjkH9LhsNYVI
02/13/2013 23:46:38,David Kelly,"My organization opened an account in 1968. I took over as treasurer in 2011 when our treasurer passed away. I was surprised by the fees they charged for our non-profit account that has maintained several thousand dollars with them for decades. When I inquired about the fees they charged for obtaining old statements (which I needed to balance our books) and to obtain cancelled checks, they recommended I get a web account to avoid those fees. The very first month, there was a fee for having a web account. I told them to stick their web account where it doesnt shione and told them that I did not want to pay any fees. They cancelled the web account and went back to a monthly account fee which made me mad as it was, but when they offered a debit card on the account and I got a recent statement, I found that they charge every time you use your debit card to make a purchase, Could I possibly hate this bank any more??? Is there a rating worse than poor? If you LOVE paying fees for EVERYTHING then you will love this bank.",2,Arkansas,ChIJAaCpYCWMyIkRjkH9LhsNYVI

09/15/2022 18:45:04,Atiya Sample,"On September 7, 2022 I visited the branch inside of the stop and shop located  in Fairfield , Connecticut. Devin, a teller, Had difficulty identifying my account. He proceeded to tell me that I was a beneficiary on a few accounts. He should NOT divulge this type of information. I explain to him what a beneficiary was and despite his claim that he knew , I didn‚Äôt believe him. If I am a beneficiary on an account I can‚Äôt possibly be the account owner , and therefore it is not my account. üôÉ Upon writing my account number on my withdrawal slip I indicated to him that he used the correct number he replied with a sigh ‚Äú that‚Äôs all you had to say.‚Äùü§î All I had To do was provide my identification as I did. It‚Äôs not my responsibility to help Devin do his job. I made a complaint with Beverly,  a manager. Beverly indicated that she would be off the next day and she will follow up with me - I have yet to receive a return phone call. I will withdraw all of my money and close the account in the very near future.

I refuse to bank with a bank that employs a rude teller that requires my assistance in identifying my account.

If you are aware that you are a beneficiary on someone‚Äôs account- DO NOT bank here!",2,Connecticut,ChIJP7T0KwoO6IkRBnXGOK6CzO8
06/09/2023 22:49:00,Sharaya Smith,"I had to go to the new M&T main branch, downtown Bpt after receiving poor service from calling the general customer service line. The agent over the phone seemed to be knowledgeable about the options available to me for my situation and she made me believe that a new card was on it's way to me. Lo and behold, I never received it. In addition, I later found out that there was no record of any new cards for me for this year even though there should have been 2. I got called up to Liljana's window, immediately when I got in line and she took care of everything, and unlike when I waited over a week previously,  she got my card delivered to me in one day! She also let me customize the card and she provided kind customer service as she has done in the past. A huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.",5,Connecticut,ChIJP7T0KwoO6IkRBnXGOK6CzO8

02/05/2022 22:51:24,JM Berkshire,"They have high fees (and they increased without warning) so I decided to move my business elsewhere. They were somewhat rude and extremely unhelpful when I tried to close my HSA account. Part way through the process they suddenly request a notarized signature even though that wasn't on the paperwork given to me.  So I opened a credit union account and asked the credit union for help. My credit union had trouble with the forms, wrong fax numbers on the forms, etc. My credit union rep told me she certainly understood why I was getting frustrated with People's. Eventually it got done, and  I was out of this nightmare of a bank. But it was probably three weeks. Help yourself out; avoid this bank if you don't like high fees and poor customer service. Oh and my employer used this bank too, but they got frustrated as well and changed banks. So it's not just peons that get treated poorly here. And they'll charge you an high fee to boot.",1,Connecticut,ChIJP7T0KwoO6IkRBnXGOK6CzO8

Every time I go to the bank, they are always so happy to see me and they ask me how I am and they ask how members of my family are doing.  They truly care about me.  They always go out of their way to help me.  They were even there for me during the pandemic.  I am honored to have met all of them.  They are like family to me.  They are always very helpful to my clients and they always go out of their way to help us.  I highly recommend going to this bank.

06/08/2022 15:45:16,Ian Olow,"Found out this morning after trying to pay a doctors bill that Peoples had stopped offering HSA's and that my HSA account was being handled by an entirely different company. I opened my Peoples App and the account was just gone. I called Peoples and they gave me the phone number for the new company that now owned my account.
My Grandmother was with Peoples before it was Peoples. She helped me open my first account with them in the 1990's. Once married, my wife and I had 5 accounts at Peoples. I am shopping around for a bank that can better serve my needs as this situation just solidifies my worries about the M&T merge.
With the amount of junk mail that I receive from Peoples, I have no doubt that I likely threw out any info about their handling of my HSA if it came by snail mail, but I revolve my finaces around their mobile app and still had NO CLUE they were doing this. Some kind of message or alert in the app would have been great, aside from going to pay a bill and being declined and then signing in to see that my account was just gone.",1,Connecticut,ChIJP7T0KwoO6IkRBnXGOK6CzO8

With covid crisis, no more travel - no more expense deposits.  They started charging $25 A MONTH to keep the account.   On line - I asked what was going on - they said I didn't keep enough in the account.  Went to a branch and said I'd like to close it due to the high maintenance fees (silly me- I thought they would care).  Nothing.  I closed the account along with my overdraft loan account.

Not to mention the quality of their products.
In my case my account which I opened with ""lifetime"" no ATM fee's was changed. Its possible I was notified by mail (along with all the other junk mail received).
I asked to have the fee's waived (only the past 2 months with which I've become aware of the ATM/Maint fee's) and the agent refused. I asked to speak with a supervisor (who was snappy and rude) who only agreed to a partial refund of one of the incidents.
Seems like this bank is more interested in making money on tiny fee's then keeping an otherwise satisfied customer of 10 years.",1,Connecticut,ChIJP7T0KwoO6IkRBnXGOK6CzO8

In addition to the personal service and the local branch folks knowing your name, M&T has always respected my time.

Update: I called the black rock branch and he gave me a new number to call to reach this branch. It was just some guy. The employee gave me the wrong number. Oh my lord, this has got to be the worst bank right?

More info because Im pissed finally found a number that works for the right branch and now I‚Äôve been on hold for 10 minutes and counting. I had an appointment for my name change, get there and the person I have an appointment with is at lunch. The guy who put everything in says give it about two weeks.

At one point, he left town for 6 days in the middle of our mortgage processing without saying a word or responding to our dozens of emergency texts, emails, and phone calls when we had an actual banking emergency that could effect our loan. When he got back to town, he said he had his laptop with him the whole time (so he was basically just ignoring us and leaving us to panic.) He didn't answer half of our questions on any given day, he dropped the ball on a lot of forms, and was clear as mud on what we should do next at every point of the process. He ADDED so much stress to an already stressful process. And they're still catching his mistakes and changing our mortgage amount even after the closing.

There was a single car at the drive in, so we pulled behind, thinking it‚Äôd be quicker than going inside. BIG mistake. After about a min the car leaves and we pull up. We‚Äôre waiting a solid 5 mins before someone even comes to the window. There‚Äôs literally 4 tellers and 1 customer. After hitting the call button twice, someone finally comes and just opens the drawer, my husband grabs a slip and she closes the drawer, doesn‚Äôt say anything, and  just walks away. So I fill out the slip and wait. And wait. And wait. Mind you, ONE customer. We hit the call button and nothing. So, I honked the horn, which I generally would NEVER do. However, it‚Äôs been close to 10 mins since getting the slip and I have to drive to Hartford to go to work. The teller helping the only customer turns around and continues to YELL that I‚Äôm the next in line, that they‚Äôre busy, (but they‚Äôre not!) and it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful that I honked. Then says I won‚Äôt be helped and can go to a different branch! All I needed was a simple withdrawal. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have honked, but she seriously overreacted. I am still a customer, not her child, and she was being FARRR more disrespectful by yelling at me. Anyway, we left (at 10:25). She was probably in her early 30s, hispanic, and had dark hair. This is just a savings account that I have here. However, I think I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere and close the account. The whole thing left a terrible taste in my mouth and I wish I had gotten her name.

I have read other reviews of M & T here, some of them actually deserving of their own critique by virtue of how easily the ""problem(s)"" could have resolved with more competence, and much less fumbling, on the part of the person writing the bad review(s). It's not that complex: You get back what you give. If you approach a situation from the outset with arrogance and little understanding of the mechanics of your issue (yet, of course, believing you know more about banking than the bankers), don't feign shock and surprise when your performance leaves them cold. They are customer service reps, not your own personal assistants. Find out about your problem first, then speak intelligently about it to them, with civility, rather than expect them to solve an issue you have made murky from the first . . . Thank you.

06/29/2023 17:30:50,Jude Ruszkay,"This bank has very inflexible rules, and a very dysfunctional internal departmental structure.

I would not bank here, especially for trust accounts.

Several examples:

- it was very difficult, almost impossible to remove a person from a joint account.

- after weeks of work and affidavit letters they finally did so but forgot to take the second person off the credit card account. Never mentioned or asked about this‚Ä¶ which created another mess

- they won‚Äôt allow you to open an estate account after someone passes, if you only get the short form from the DE registrar of wills, which is the normal form for estates less than $30,000.

- they froze the deceased account and stopped auto payment on the credit card account so it ended up with late fees, and it took 3 special visits to the bank to get this corrected.

- while in the branch office, the bank staff cannot or will not contact the credit card division, and we were unable to collect cc reward points or use them against the cc balance due. I had to call the cc division while standing at the teller and speak to both individually, and they still couldn‚Äôt fix the problem.

- bank will not allow online bill payment from trust accounts, you have to use paper checks!!!

This bank operates like it the 19th century.

Many other regional banks offer much better service and coordination",1,Delaware,ChIJe3JPB0r8xokR7Ma6-H0daJc

07/17/2017 19:02:50,Samantha Casson,I would really like to commend this particular branch for their professional demeanor when dealing with a tough situation.  I visited this branch earlier today to make a deposit with a teller and as I entered the bank I noticed one teller was already busy with a customer who seemed very frustrated .  Long story short apparently the customer was trying to deposit a check that exceeded the amount that that particular teller was allowed to deposit without the approval of a bank manager.  At that time the bank manager was with another customer working on some paperwork.  The woman trying to deposit a check became very irate and was growing louder and louder as the moment went on .  Did tell her that I was with just looked at me like she was so upset and so frustrated and she actually apologized for the woman disrupting my time in the bank .  A few moments later when the bank manager was done with her customer and was coming over to assist this particular customer and bank teller the situation escalated as the woman continue to shout about how this was awful customer service.  At that time I had had enough and I simply looked over at the woman and I said that she should be more respectful to people who are handling her money . She yelled at me to mind my own business to which I replied it was very challenging to do so when she was yelling enough for the entire shopping center to hear .  At this point she not only continue to belittle and be read the entire bank and their trailers but also began to do the same to me .  I held my ground and continue to be respectful while letting her know that her actions and her behavior was deplorable to say the least  . She continued to yell the bank tell that I was working with looked over at me and thanked me for standing up for them and told me that she really appreciated it  . I make sure to commend her and the entire bank on their amazing customer service and remaining so cool in a situation that could have escalated much further had they not been calm and respectful to a woman who did not deserve it .,5,Delaware,ChIJE0J1ILz8xokRQ4xY2Ual5uE

The staff at the Millville location are absolutely WONDERFUL people..! They are courteous, knowledgeable, and ALWAYS very helpful..! It is an absolute joy to bank at the M&T Millville branch. Paula, Anita, Cyndi, Tom, Souzan and manager Shani (to mention a few that we have dealt with) ALL receive 7 stars ( with 5 being the highest )...! We have had the need to visit this location quite a few times for various reasons over the last 3 years, and EVERY SINGLE TIME, our questions, issues, and non issues were handled promptly and professionally. The ladies that staff the drive thru, are ALWAYS friendly. This all being said, I have NO IDEA how a negative review could even be written about the staff in Millville.  I encourage ANYONE looking for a bank down in this area, to look to this location to meet your banking needs.

My account was put on hold for sending a Zelle payment to a recipient I often send money to, my landlord, because of ‚Äúlegal issues‚Äù. But I was unable to get any form of information or help. I went into the bank on a Saturday, because on the phone they said I needed to come into the bank, no specific day or time just come into the bank. Turns out the legal team is not available on the weekends so I was left for 2 days with no access to my account or the money in the account. With this being my ONLY account I explained my frustration with two different team members at the bank and I was basically met with the energy of ‚Äúit‚Äôs your problem, wait until Monday that‚Äôs all I can tell you‚Äù (Not exactly the employees words but that‚Äôs the energy she gave off when I asked what I was supposed to do) needless to say, I will be closing my account with M&T.",1,Delaware,ChIJ30MDK-Fwx4kREuLmtM2R6FM

Also our intention was to open an account for her. When we went in the two tellers were not pleasant at all to begin with. We asked if she could could cash her check and they said no! Now we knew we could deposit her check in our account but, when we asked out of respect for them they replied no!  Now mind you, I was with my bf who is Caucasian a couple of days ago with her daughter and she deposited her daughter‚Äôs check in her account and there was no problem with that same teller. Now I‚Äôm feeling we are being racially profiled. When asked to speak to a manager another head teller I believe took a look at our account and the check and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the problem and she deposited the check. One teller just walked off as if she didn‚Äôt see us. The other kept looking at our account like she‚Äôs in disbelief. Then she came up with the excuse that policies change all the time. My point is if you weren‚Äôt sure why wouldn‚Äôt you check instead of blatantly telling us no? We try to avoid this branch because, they‚Äôve always been very unfriendly. We definitely DO NOT want her to open an account here. We took her to Bank of America to open her checking. We are seriously thinking about moving our accounts as well.

It seems like they cannot wait for you to get out our there line.  I don't understand why they are not trained in customer service. This makes the managers look bad. And it's not just this branch.

05/09/2023 17:19:04,Vanessa Chery,"This branch used to have great in-person and over-the-phone customer service, which is expected because it‚Äôs a small bank. However, it seems they have hired some new staff and there‚Äôs one in particular who has zero patience, zero professionalism in-person or over the phone. This particular employee to my misfortune, is always the one who answers me. She has poor listening skills and is always quick to interrupt customers mid-sentence while speaking to them in an aggravated and condescending tone. She puts customers on hold without informing them of it first, leaving them wondering if she‚Äôs still on the line. On one of several occasions, I had to call the branch to request that they prepare a document for me. In the past, I would request the document over the phone, they would prepare it for me and I would come to pick it up. But on that day, she was of course the one who answered, and after interrupting me several times to reiterate that I needed to come in-person, she placed me on hold without warning. I thought she hung up but waited a few moments; she returned and said it‚Äôs actually okay for me to request the document over-the-phone, which is what I was trying to tell her was done for me in the past all along but she initially refused to listen. It is incredibly frustrating to remain patient with someone who possesses such little ability to listen to and understand others. She has no business handling customers. But anyway, she then said they would get it ready and I could come pick it up right away. When I arrived in-person to pick-up the document (which was 45 minutes after I called the branch), she was also the only teller available to help me. I told her I spoke to her about requesting a document and am here to pick it up. She abruptly responded ‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt know who you spoke to but you‚Äôre going to have to wait because it takes a long time to get it ready. You can come back later or tomorrow .‚Äù At this point, I had no patience to deal with her, but didn‚Äôt want to create a scene, so I just asked how long will it take and chose to wait for it. I don‚Äôt want to share the employee‚Äôs name but she knows who she is. If in the future when I call or visit, her interaction with customers doesn‚Äôt improve, I will just have to report her. I used to love this branch. The older employees are always kind and welcoming. But lately, this particular employee who is always the voice/face I hear/see when I call/visit the branch, is really turning me off. I will not drop her name in the review but I will certainly call M&T Bank and report her. Ruining the bank‚Äôs reputation for great attention to customers.",2,Georgia,ChIJb5OUiYnIt4kREyuxxiMHZKA

Then they needed more and the owner of the company in too. Then they needed our documents notarized and they wouldn't notarized me because I'm not a customer but they would the other two since they were customers.

09/19/2020 14:08:22,NCT,"Me and my fiance went on vacation 19 days ago, and got robbed. So we don't have hard IDs and our bank cards any longer, of course. Yesterday my fiance went to this branch with his paper ID and his work ID and paystubs. He provided my whole name as well as his, and both our socials, since we have a joint account. When we first got back we went to a different Branch, that helped us take out a few hundred dollars from our account given the circumstances, and she told us we could do that once to each different Branch until we got out new IDs. (Which is harder rn due to covid). So yesterday, he went to this location without me, thinking it would be okay since it was okay at a different Branch, not thinking that he'd be harassed based purely off of the color of his skin. They refused to help him. They acted like all his documents were ""photo shopped"" as well as acting like his signature was incorrect, as though the reps at this location are signature specialists. But if they were, they'd know it's a little different each time. Common sense. But my fiance is a Mexican American. I am a white woman. They didn't act like any of my information was fake when I went with him, but then again the rep we had when we were together was a beautiful black woman, so she probably wasn't intimidated by the color of his skin, nor did she aggressively assume that he was lying about everything. His usually simple trip the bank yesterday ended in the manager, Michael, threatening to call the police on him. And I've known this man for 10 years - he doesn't get loud. He's horrible with confrontation, I know he wasn't combative, though they said he was. I have known people to SAY he's aggressive, for simply standing still simply because he's a Mexican man who's buff and tattooed. Scary right? The worst part is - this branch is walking distance to a Mexican grocery store. Absolutely disgusting. We will absolutely be switching banks as soon as I get my ID, because now I know I have to be there with him, BECAUSE IF HE GOES ALONE SOMEONE WILL CALL THE COPS ON HIM. Obviously we are frustrated by lack of access to the money directly deposited each week. 19 days of bills being unpaid and no money, and making weekly deposits. No way to get a new government ID because of covid. Seriously you couldn't be better?",1,Maryland,ChIJPSUmIdUCyIkRCJgZ5wcM8rY

(I sent a roll of dimes, a roll of nickels, and three one dollar bills asking for a roll of quarters and an empty quarter roller so I could roll up my loose quarters and be in my way.) Nothing but a miserable and nasty attitude from the older blonde woman (who refused to give me her name when I asked for it) who then gave me further attitude and rolled her eyes, muttering something under her breath when I told her since she was unwilling to help me in the drive through, that I would be cashing in loose change as well.

I entered the bank on January 30 2013 to cash a check; I have 2 business accounts and a personal account with M and T Bank. I signed the check and put a thumb print while waiting for the Teller.

When she came she was looking up the account and had to receive approval because of the amount of the check"". This was a new account but I am not a new Customer. The other Teller comes and starts asking who the owner of the company is, where else did I try to cash the check, and treating me as if I was a thug that just came off the streets:. My check had cleared and been validated, the Teller proceeds to help other people without letting me know anything when I asked what is going on she tells me that they are working on it and she doesn't know what they are doing"".

So I asked to speak to a Manager and she says the Manager is in the back working on something. After I insisted on a Manager and raised my voice then someone came from the back and guided me to the Manager, as I arrived in the Managers office she is calling the bank I opened the account with inquiring on my intentions.

I was never asked any questions; they were treating me as if I had bad intentions, without explaining or asking any clarifying questions! They didn't even research to see if I had any other accounts/.The customer service at this location is very unprofessional and the Tellers are very unhelpful, if you can go to another location or better yet go to another bank.",2,Maryland,ChIJPSUmIdUCyIkRCJgZ5wcM8rY

Signed up on line and had problems with some DocuSign email. Had it just been part of a prompt wile setting up the account the signature would have been done. This branch has its customer service staff behind closed doors so they don't have to help you .. regardless they took my deposit online and are holding my money hostage. Capital one opened my daughter's account without a valid drivers license. It's amazing how they don't need the business. So I wouldn't bank there their staff have Avery difficult time treating you as an individual person not just a number. Doesn't matter that I have been in the hospital on an off for 4yrs and on a ventilator. Ms Rahman was more interested in only doing what she had to not attempting to just treat me like a human being. She couldn't stand that  I would be upset and curse because she was holding my rent hostage because she was following order or policy.

I received a call from the customer service department , who addressed politely all my concerns. I appreciate that because it shows they do value their customers despite everything . I hope to continue doing business  with this bank and will be returning in the near future  . Thanks Candi for all your help .

Initial review :
The teller damaris Fuentes needs a crash course in customer service . I came in to make a withdrawal .. kind of really don‚Äôt understand why I have to get quizzed and Interrogated  about if an account is mine especially after I hand over my drivers license and my debit card. She then has the guts to proceed to asking me who my employer is .. as though employers don‚Äôt change she tells me it‚Äôs not the correct answer ? How silly is that ? This is the first bank that when I  go  to collect my money that I deposit through the atm I have to have palpitations when I venture in to withdraw ?after answering 2 of her questions and according to her my 3rd answer was wrong for a third silly question she posed to me , she had an attitude , just handed me my bills without proceeding to run it through the machine in my presence . I am supposed to believe whatever bills she gave me were accurate . And that is after she had the guts to tell me she will give me a mixed set of bills fyi ..without me asking her . The last time I checked it‚Äôs my money . You aren‚Äôt giving me money like you are doing me a favor . I went over to another bank with much better customer service . With this attitude , real soon I will be pulling my funds from this bank . She really needs a crash course on customer service .. that‚Äôs part of her job .",3,Maryland,ChIJMdBIOBPdt4kRvhYRVORdprw

06/05/2022 05:13:50,Taylor Washington,"I visited M&T Bank on 6/5/22. After my multiple poor experiences with customer service I am changing banks. I know longer have trust in them with my money. I had an unauthorized purchase with my card. I called and spoke to someone on May 28th. She told me she was sending out a new card and canceled my other card. I then called back a few minutes later because I had a question.  The lady asked for my social security number. I did not feel comfortable as I put in the same information as I did over the phone with the automated system and the other person who I spoke with did not ask for that information. The lady was very rude and disrespectful. When I was asking questions regarding the information I put in the system. She then hung up on me. I then called again and put my same information in the recording and another lady answered she was nice and explained my questions and also gave an excuse as to why the lady needed my information when I already put in it the automatic phone system.

Experience at laurel branch: I spoke with a manager a few years ago regarding workers at this location nothing as changed. Not having a card since 5/28/22 I needed to go to the bank and withdraw cash. I also had a money order I wanted to cash. I then asked the man if he knew when my card would come and about the investigation with the purchase. The man looked in the system and told me that the card was never ordered but it was cancelled and that it would take 5 -6 business days not including today or tomorrow as tomorrow was Sunday. At that moment I was in shock and angry. I told the man that I was already told that last week. I then asked if there was any way to get the card faster. The man told me I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve never done that. The other man next to him said you can expedite it and wave the fee. The man then asked my for my social security number. After I put my account number on the deposit slip, gave him my ID, and verified four of my last purchases and deposits within my M&T app prior. I told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with giving that information. I‚Äôve gotten a card before at a different location. They did not ask me for my social. He then told me I already have it and just wanted you to write it down. He the proceeded to write my social security number on a paper. It honestly felt like he was taunting me. At that point I did not want to deal with him or the situation. And made that clear. During that conversation he said I would not have a job if they did not trust me. In addition he said you have your money you can go. The withdrawal was completed first. We were at the attempt of issuing a new card. Both comments were extremely unprofessional and nothing was accomplished as I still don‚Äôt have a card.

This caused issues on my account that lasted over a week. When asked by their back end customer support team to explain the issues, rather than looking into my account activity and doing the math to see that my complaint was justified, they once again brushed it off. There are several other M&T branches in the area, I recommend going to one of those instead. I never see anyone at this branch, now I know why.",1,Maryland,ChIJsTL1XPsfyIkRti-e61sXyE0

The staff does not want to assist customers and generally act annoyed at people who enter the branch seeking in-person services.  The tellers will often simply act like they don't know what the customer is talking about, try to send them away, and if asking for a supervisor will say ""the manager"", whoever this is, is never there and is always off that particular day.  I have also seen tellers throw away signature pages and bank documents after I leave, probably because they didn't know what to do with them or didn't care - had a teller just two days ago throw away a statement about an unauthorized charge, promoting me to go back into the bank and demand he take it out of the trash and add it to my file.  Also, entering after 2PM will always get a response that they are ""closing soon"" and can't help, even though the bank does not technically close until 5PM.  I was there just the other day, came in at 3PM, to have one of the desk workers say she was no longer talking customers but then a few moments later helped an elderly couple, which she was obviously friends with and was happy to see, who had entered at 3:15.

When I asked assistance to provide me with an M&T location in the area that can do a notary today, the bank teller said to call around.

I have visited this branch probably five times during my lunch break for extremely basic transactions. It is very clear that the teller views customers as an annoyance, rather than the reason why she is there.

I also have an account at the PNC a block down the road, and the difference in my experience as a customer is night and day. I have had much better experience with the other M&T in Bethesda--farther away, but still a faster ordeal.",1,Maryland,ChIJRSeQC3vJt4kRObF9qnPmGhY

Staff are rude - well one specific lady - I would say her name but she did not even introduce herself. She look and sound as if she is from  Southern Asia. Not a  friendly place for small business banking. I went in to open a small business account - After waiting for some time the nameless lady asked me to return in 3 hours. I did just that - once I returned she told her coworker that the lady in small business banking was out to lunch - when I could clearly see the representative sitting at her desk, not eating lunch. Her coworker of African descent explained to her southern Asian counter part that I had clearly been waiting for sometime. She Responded to her coworker I needed to wait some more. She did not even bother taking down my name or phone number. I guess M&T does not  need any new business,  don‚Äôt even waste your time. The reviews dating back months and years are absolutely true.

When you go here you will be harassed about opening an account with M&T, no matter how much you don't want one. After saying no several times your teller will go from friendly to rude. Your cash will be roughly shoved under the window and your change will practically be thrown at you. Avoid going to this branch ever if you can and stay away from the wide variety of high fees M&T bank offers for it's ""services"".

I've waited  8 months  I have not received one contact from  M & T regarding the fraud case I identified.  I'm out $ 500.   Very very frustrating.  I've noticed in other states that M & T customers file complaints with the local banking commission because M & T does not do anything about fraud cases under a certain amount.

They have one teller on duty to handle people for massive business banking and people with quick transactions. Last time in bank took 35 minutes wait in line, at the main Cabot St. location, to just get to a teller. Considering changing banks as this customer service is unacceptable.

They must of ASSUMED EVERYONE would not come to the bank BEFORE the snow came? They did the same thing early on due to COVID...the bank never changed their website info to inform customers they would be opening later and put me out of my way to get there at opening time and find I had I to sit in my car and wait for them to open a 1/2 hour later.

01/01/2022 03:03:47,Patti Giangregorio,"I can remember when it was originally called Tele-Comm bank & located on the corner of Main St & Ferry St (across from the High School) here in Malden, MA. Since then it has changed ""ownership"", starting with Danvers Bank which then moved to it's current location on the corner of Center St & Commercial St (across from the Malden Center train station).

About 5-7 yrs ago (?), People's United bought out Danversbank & it's branches here in Malden. No matter what, the staff whether they were apart of the Tele-Comm or Danvers, have ALWAYS been there for my mother since this was HER bank after we moved from the Malden-Everett line area back in 2000 to where I am now. Sadly my mom passed away earlier this month & last week, I had to close out her bank account.

The branch manager & his colleague went above & beyond to help me w/ this heartbreaking task. I will NEVER EVER forget ALL of the different branch managers, tellers, etc that I've come to know since 2000. I greatly appreciate all their help w/ my mother's personal finances as well as just being there w/ a friendly smile (even behind a ""mask"" these past 2 yrs).

I don‚Äôt often go inside the branch but when I have the Tellers have been very friendly and willing to help. I love the M&T app as it‚Äôs super fast and it is well designed. The only issue I encounter with M&T regularly is that the ATMs can be finicky with depositing cash. If I were to guess every 4 times I deposit cash it spits two or three bills out that are in perfect condition. If I go to a different ATM it will usually, accept the bills. While it's a minor inconvenience in the long run it does get frustrating. Otherwise, banking with M&T is a breeze. When I was younger I wasn't as responsible as I should have been with my bank accounts and I ended up bankless for a while.

M&T Is one of the best popular banks in the regular financial market which brings the important enterprise. They do pretty good on their service. (Review) As a first there I did take a visit to their area, they welcome me and one lady ask me what can I help you with ? Customer Service I answer. (M&T Associate) okay it will be on  the next hour. I'm like alright. 1 hour 40 minutes later I return there and she guide me to the assistant staff who can help me. The one who help customers to create account is Ms. Doris Ventura it was cool, she had a confident time in the moment. Yes, she very helpful on the basis terms. [Notice] Sometimes there can be available to help customers out in creating account, most of the times they can't because due to booking appointments for service.

10/09/2020 18:27:22,Melissa T,"Awful customer service. I would recommend banking somewhere else. This bank doesn't honor its promotions and then uses excuses to not help make the situation right in good faith. They'll do anything to get you to open an account and then provide you with no follow-up support. Oh, and there's a high turnover rate. The banking rep who opened my account left two months after I opened the account almost a year ago.  Also, what's very disturbing is the current manager won't call you back if you have an issue and then gives you misinformation. The rep who answers the phone will say "" he's in a meeting"" or some made up excuse so this manager doesn't have to do his job.
This bank doesn't realize that customers do know when managers and reps are not telling the truth about "" there's nothing we can do."" Sure you can - it is a matter of doing it, if you want the business long-term. And, its reportable to the FDIC or BBB.

Long story short...Julia helped us find her branch and made the experience pleasant. Even to the point of being willing to stay late to accommodate us in our plight.  It was so nice in an age of incivility to find three young ladies showing more than civility...kindness for folks they don't know.

Today, I went to this bank to open an account with my husband and some lady asked me to handle her my phone to check the details of a $250 bonus that I asked about. When she gave the my phone back, I took a napkin and cleaned my phone with sanitizer. She was so rude to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick‚Äù with the worst attitude.
First of all, I wasn‚Äôt trying to offend her by cleaning MY phone with the sanitizer THEY made available. Furthermore, how would I know is she is sick or not? No one walks around with a sign on their forehead stating their COVID-19 diagnosis. Also, if the sanitizer is on display on the desk is for people to use it. My thing is why did she get offended because I desinfected my phone? and, If she did get offended, why would she had the nerve to make that comment like people are not to use the sanitizer because if they do, she feels attacked? It was so disrespectful. Also, we were wearing normal everyday-clothes and she treat us like we did not belong in there. She has the smallest mind in the planet, she assumed we had no money but when she saw we weren‚Äôt opening the account with the minimal amount she was surprised. I was like wow this female is so ignorant. She wasn‚Äôt dressed any better than us and to go open a bank account people don‚Äôt need to wear suits. I wasn‚Äôt scheduled with her but Loida was busy.

Made 2 trips and they still cant seem to give me the information or action I need.  Fairly new girl didn't know how to provide the services needed. I suggested I run other errands and return after lunch.  To my shock they hadn't worked on a resolution at all.  If you put money in there make sure you keep a beneficiary on the account. Apparently they don't recognize estate admins!!

UPDATE. So I received a call setting up an appointment for today.  I show up for an 3rd appointment to be told that the lady I had an appointment with called out sick.  And no one else can help me because they are short staffed. I have asked for the manager to call me 3 times now and am now headed out to meet with a covering manager.  Never dealt with anything like this before.  Never do business with them again.",1,Michigan,ChIJKdxjjuySyYkRnZyCtO2VRy8

09/14/2023 20:31:36,Rhonda W,"I have a problem with this branch nearly every time I go in. I called Tues. to ask if there was a notary, I was told yes. I asked if they had a specific lunchtime that I should avoid and was told no. I immediately drove to the branch only to find out that he had several appointments waiting and was told I could make an appt. online. Why was I not given that option when I called in? They could not schedule it in the office. Appt. in hand, I came in with my documents the next day only to be told they could not be notarized because there was a correction. As a notary I know this is false. I had to explain to the notary what the actual job of a notary was. He said ""I just took the test to renew so I know this can't be done"" Well guess what I just took the test as well and you are wrong. He still refused. I called the National Notary Association from a verified number on speaker and got their trained expert who also told him the job of a notary and that he of course can notarize a document that had a correction. He still was not comfortable. He went to confer with one of M & T Banks notable Notary experts and I could hear him mocking me in a derisive voice stating she said ""she has been a notary for 20 years and actually called the NNA for clarification and they stated it could be notarized."" He then returned and said that he still did not feel comfortable and refused the notary. I had to drive all the way back to the office print additional copies of the form and drive back to the branch for a 3rd time. This was a jurat and I should have been asked to swear to the truthfulness of the statements in the document but the ""notary expert"" never even did that. This is just the latest issue in a long list that they can't seem to figure out. It would be nice if they properly trained their staff.",1,Michigan,ChIJgRmFXcX2t4kRqRrw__OCLLo
08/27/2021 03:44:33,Cherron Robinson,"The bank is extremely slow with clearing checks that were suppose to be cleared days ago. M&T is one of the most known banks but it might just be be the worst. It's very hard to obtain your own money. The customer support member at the branch decided to hang up on me as I was about to ask a question. Instead she says ""Okay"" and hangs up. Very unprofessional. I recommend going to a different branch. It's worth the extra drive. Or simply switch to a new bank.",2,Michigan,ChIJgRmFXcX2t4kRqRrw__OCLLo
09/04/2019 18:27:43,D M,"Horrible wait time, worse customer service. I waited for about 20 minutes to get seen by one of 2 customer service reps in branch. Once I got in the private office, the woman was very abrupt and abrasive towards my simple request. There was printer trouble (which was not her fault) and instead of asking if it would be okay if she helped someone with a notary...she states that she is doing it and leaves the office to attend to someone else. I think the most disappointing thing was when she made an error for my request, instead of acting contrite when I pointed it out, she gives an obnoxiously loud sigh, and goes to the computer with heavy clicks/keyboard presses. As a customer, it was apparent that she was not happy doing her job in helping me, and I was more of a bother than a customer of M&T. This is the first time I went into this branch and I can say with 100% certainty that I will drive to my hometown branch when I need service rather than go to this one again which is closer to my work. I was going to put a complaint to the manager but it didn't look like there was a team leader or manager on the floor.

When I got there I asked for the person that I was supposed to meet and I only received the answer : ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs off on Fridays, but someone else can help you‚Äù I asked the tellers and anyone was willing to help me. They were rough and didn‚Äôt provide me accurate information because I wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúClient of the bank‚Äù

I was pretty upset and I left the place immediately.

My opinion is about this branch located at 11 W 42 St and I can‚Äôt say that the other branches offer a similar service.

I went today in person to this branch. I presented my debit card, and my ID. However, the bank teller asked me many questions. who is your employer? In which branch did you open this account? Write the first digit number of your social security number?
Moreover, the bank teller was staring at with little confidence even though he had my debit card, my ID card, and I answered all his questions.
By the way, this is not the first time they treated me like this.
I‚Äôve been dealing with Bank of America and chase branches. When you go in person and you present your ID and your debit card, all they ask is to inter your PIN number, nothing else.

Today, I went to this bank to open an account with my husband and some lady asked me to handle her my phone to check the details of a $250 bonus that I asked about. When she gave the my phone back, I took a napkin and cleaned my phone with sanitizer. She was so rude to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick‚Äù with the worst attitude.
First of all, I wasn‚Äôt trying to offend her by cleaning MY phone with the sanitizer THEY made available. Furthermore, how would I know is she is sick or not? No one walks around with a sign on their forehead stating their COVID-19 diagnosis. Also, if the sanitizer is on display on the desk is for people to use it. My thing is why did she get offended because I desinfected my phone? and, If she did get offended, why would she had the nerve to make that comment like people are not to use the sanitizer because if they do, she feels attacked? It was so disrespectful. Also, we were wearing normal everyday-clothes and she treat us like we did not belong in there. She has the smallest mind in the planet, she assumed we had no money but when she saw we weren‚Äôt opening the account with the minimal amount she was surprised. I was like wow this female is so ignorant. She wasn‚Äôt dressed any better than us and to go open a bank account people don‚Äôt need to wear suits. I wasn‚Äôt scheduled with her but Loida was busy.

08/23/2021 17:14:40,Fillip Nelson,"I'm am not sure to blame this situation on the bank M&T itself for lack of training, or if this is something that falls on the branch.

I went in the branch on Wednesday, August 19, 2021 to initiate a wire transfer. I went up to the teller and she told me I have to schedule that service.

She told me the person that does the wire transfer is not in at the moment, and she was at that point going to let me walk out the door.

Before leaving, I  turned back around to re-approach the teller and asked, ""ok, well how can I schedule a transfer""? She gave me a sticky note to write down my name and phone number, and said she will try her best to get one scheduled for today.  The tone was very nonchalant to the point that it just made the statement unbelieve or that she could care less.

The wire was needed to close on a home.

After I got home, I waited for about one hour and sided with my intuition that no one was going to call me back and instead went to my other bank Chase on MLK to Initiate a wire which took about 15 minutes.

It is now the 23rd and I have yet to get a call back.

I am so glad I did not chose them as a lender to close on the home. It could have been disastrous.

I think at this point I will pull my funds from M&T bank and transfer to Chase, the customer service, lack of staff, and lack of concern at this branch is alarming. I would suggest the current employees be retrained.",1,Montana,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU

I asked if they had a specific lunchtime that I should avoid and was told no. I immediately drove to the branch only to find out that he had several appointments waiting and was told I could make an appt. online. Why was I not given that option when I called in? They could not schedule it in the office. Appt. in hand, I came in with my documents the next day only to be told they could not be notarized because there was a correction. As a notary I know this is false. I had to explain to the notary what the actual job of a notary was. He said ""I just took the test to renew so I know this can't be done"" Well guess what I just took the test as well and you are wrong. He still refused. I called the National Notary Association from a verified number on speaker and got their trained expert who also told him the job of a notary and that he of course can notarize a document that had a correction. He still was not comfortable. He went to confer with one of M & T Banks notable Notary experts and I could hear him mocking me in a derisive voice stating she said ""she has been a notary for 20 years and actually called the NNA for clarification and they stated it could be notarized."" He then returned and said that he still did not feel comfortable and refused the notary. I had to drive all the way back to the office print additional copies of the form and drive back to the branch for a 3rd time. This was a jurat and I should have been asked to swear to the truthfulness of the statements in the document but the ""notary expert"" never even did that.

There was printer trouble (which was not her fault) and instead of asking if it would be okay if she helped someone with a notary...she states that she is doing it and leaves the office to attend to someone else. I think the most disappointing thing was when she made an error for my request, instead of acting contrite when I pointed it out, she gives an obnoxiously loud sigh, and goes to the computer with heavy clicks/keyboard presses. As a customer, it was apparent that she was not happy doing her job in helping me, and I was more of a bother than a customer of M&T. This is the first time I went into this branch and I can say with 100% certainty that I will drive to my hometown branch when I need service rather than go to this one again which is closer to my work.

11/02/2022 17:34:50,David B,"Now two corporate offices. I figured I‚Äôd rate this one, so to balance the high score as opposed to the low score downtown. I have been a customer for more than 20 years. What was a local bank grew into a bureaucratic entity. Unfortunately, my IRA switched hands 3 times, and now after gradual growth, has slipped below its initial investment almost 10 years ago. I have been paying fees, and just received a letter that I owe money. One Wilmington Advisors rep stated that this was an error, and would be fixed, and that they would forward me to call back from a financial advisor; I made clear that my last discussion with one was of little progress, and would like to speak with someone senior. I received a call today, from someone new. I found out that this was not a mistake, I owe them money, even though they‚Äôve lost $1000s of mine. When I shook a hand at the branch and agreed to management fees, I thought I was being managed. Now, after a significant and consistent loss, the once MandT, then LPL, now Wilmington Advisors tells me, now those are holding fees, no one is managing. My money would have been safer in CDs like most of my money is. I was told I was on the conservative side of aggressive, in a 2045 retirement. Lies. Big business ethics, and shifting responsibility, just like any big business. When appropriate, I‚Äôll be pulling my money out!

07/20/2021 17:59:11,Treva Patterson,"Having to deal with this bank after my Fathers death has been the most difficult, frustrating and painful experience. Their customer service is non-existent and their company policies completely lack empathy and flexibility. All of their staff seem to have scripts they read from and no matter your circumstance that's it, they could not possibly care less about you, move on, it's not their problem because computer says no. Not to mention you get different answers to each question depending on who you speak to and each department seems to know nothing about the other, absolutely no consistency across their business. I will say that I did speak to some nice ladies but as nice as they were they made promises they did not follow through on.

Only to be informed by the new manger who had no idea what I was talking about that it would take another 90 days to process the new paperwork.  They were also very rude and unhelpful throughout the whole process, including refusing to show my paperwork that I had every right to see.  Finally a woman who was a temp from another branch was there filling in and not only gave me the requested paperwork but had my account credited with the lost money within the week.  I closed my account with M&T after 10 years because of this one branch.

Plus when I called she lied and said she fixed it. Edit‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs one in the morning now and the money still hasn‚Äôt posted to my account. I deposited cash. Me and my dogs have been starving all night because some teller decided she didn‚Äôt want me to have money tonight. Why would cash need to be cleared with this bank? Every other bank puts cash right into the account no waiting period. Makes no sense and why was I told by multiple people at the call center they were sorry that the teller put it in wrong and that the money would post at midnight. The bank tellers and the call center people are a bunch of liars. I‚Äôm sooo f ing pissed and hungry right now can‚Äôt even sleep.

Except if you are a retired elder receiving social security benefits they do not offer the convenience of cash withdrawal on Direct Xpress government card. Supposedly they need a special machine for this action. Seniors walk over to the 7 Eleven to withdraw no fee ATM then deposit with M&T. For the more hip generation used to convenience and accessibility NEW September 2018 they have just begun to use Zelle. And they also are now working with Apple Pay and Android pay. I prefer the online convenience. However when I added my M&T card to wallet on iPhone I was forced to call customer service. They informed me I must go in to the branch for approval of my card for Apple Pay. What?? Waste of time.
On another note, every time I go in to the bank the teller says I could have deposited through ATM. Well thanks but I want to be sure it‚Äôs received and processed right away.

Moreover, the bank teller was staring at with little confidence even though he had my debit card, my ID card, and I answered all his questions.
By the way, this is not the first time they treated me like this.

Have been on the phone for over 5 hours waiting to speak to a representative in the fraud department since they blocked my card for trying to make a purchase of $350. I'm amazed at how rude and incompetent the staff is. Couldn't even transfer my call instead decided to just give me the number. I also tried transferring money person to person through the zelle app and was unable to since they blocked me from doing so. Unbelievable!

07/20/2021 17:59:11,Treva Patterson,"Having to deal with this bank after my Fathers death has been the most difficult, frustrating and painful experience. Their customer service is non-existent and their company policies completely lack empathy and flexibility. All of their staff seem to have scripts they read from and no matter your circumstance that's it, they could not possibly care less about you, move on, it's not their problem because computer says no. Not to mention you get different answers to each question depending on who you speak to and each department seems to know nothing about the other, absolutely no consistency across their business. I will say that I did speak to some nice ladies but as nice as they were they made promises they did not follow through on. No wonder with all of their branches nearly all of them have less than a 3 star rating on Google. Such a shame.",1,New York,ChIJ3_h_V1ZYwokRWPtrI_6AYH8

Only to be informed by the new manger who had no idea what I was talking about that it would take another 90 days to process the new paperwork.  They were also very rude and unhelpful throughout the whole process, including refusing to show my paperwork that I had every right to see.  Finally a woman who was a temp from another branch was there filling in and not only gave me the requested paperwork but had my account credited with the lost money within the week.  I closed my account with M&T after 10 years because of this one branch. Having a clearly forged check be allowed to be cashed is one thing, but having to wait from January 2nd to July 15th before I even was credited for the funds is unacceptable.",1,New York,ChIJ3_h_V1ZYwokRWPtrI_6AYH8

When i asked about a payroll check deposit on Saturday he told me it would not be available until next Thursday 5 days later. He was more then determined to express he is correct and i will not have my money until 5 days from now. My check ended up being available Tuesday 2 business days later.

I always prefer to do all my transactions with the next teller who always lets me know about new promotions. It's a shame, had it not been for her behavior, I would have allocated all of my savings into this bank but when all the other competent tellers are off or not available and I have to be stuck with her handling my transaction, it's better to go elsewhere to another bank and receive better services as well as better interest rates.",1,New York,ChIJ84b4oCRZwokRWopHTfZ217U

Our first was last year for our recent move and most recently a debt consolidation last month.  My husband and I took the time and researched around and found them to offer the lower rates. Super intimidating at first most especially when we don't understand how the whole process on getting a loan begins but they were knowledgable, professional, patient in answering our questions and most of all super fast with everything . They processed all the required documents we turned in so quickly and made everything simple on our end.

Withdrawing money from you own Checking account is more intense than returning a product to Best Buy after the 14-day window. Anyway, a portion of my conversation with the glass lady (Ms. Jimenez) went like this:
Me: Hi, I would like to withdraw some money. May I have a slip?
Ms. Jimenez: You need a check for that.
Me: A check???
Ms: Jimenez: Yes, personal check. Give me you ID and the debit card.
Me: Here's my driver's license, but I don't have a debit card.
Ms. Jimenez: Why?
Me: Not many people use one these days.
Ms. Jimenez (sarcastically): Everybody uses one. Why do you need the money?
Me: I need to pay rent.
Ms. Jimenez: Give me more information. When did you open the account? Where you opened it? What was the last amount you withdrew? What is exact present balance?
Me: Let me login into my account.
After a while I succeeded. No more questions. Just:
Ms. Jimenez: Make sure the signature matches the one on your driver's license.

My birthday present was delivered here by mistake. My boyfriend went to pick up the package. The three women he spoke with would not give him the package even though his name was on the package and he had his CA ID which does not have my NY address on it.

They said we will hold onto it and your girlfriend needs to come with her ID to pick it up.

At 2pm after my calls I go to pick up the package to find out they gave the package back to UPS. They couldn‚Äôt wait just 3 hours ‚Äî they gave back my present that they said they would hold onto and then gave me attitude about it.

03/30/2022 05:10:11,Kira Marie,"It was very imperative to me that I take the time to make this review because the miserable individuals who work at this bank are drowning in both internalized and externalized racism and they need to be checked immediately! Now let me first start off by saying I have lived in this neighborhood my entire life, used to walk past this bank at all different stages of my life, it wasn‚Äôt until this year as a grown adult I finally made my way inside of it. My fianc√© had received a check from a car dealership after he had tried to purchase a car from them and the deal went through, they returned his deposit in a check. The business owner did his banking with M&T bank so when we went to my fianc√©‚Äôs  bank (TD Bank) they recommended we walked up the street to M&T because we would be able to get the funds faster from the bank which the check was written from. On the five minute walk there, I called them to explain the situation and spoke to the rudest woman I have ever spoken to in my life over the phone, she was so dismissive and condescending and somehow managed to profile us over the phone, told us they would not cash the check because we didn‚Äôt bank with them. I was flabbergasted but I‚Äôm not the type of person to take that lying down, so I told my fianc√©e we were still going to the bank! I first went up to confront the lady who I spoke to over the phone, while my fianc√© stayed in the waiting area with our child. I asked for the lady I spoke to on the phone and proceeded to ask her why she thought she could speak to me the way she did, and demanded she give me an actual reason why the check could not be cashed‚Ä¶she was extremely RACIST and disrespectful and treated me like a criminal! Now me and my fianc√© switch and he goes up, surprise surprise she cashed the check for him. Guess what the difference is between me and my fianc√©? üë©üèæ‚Äçü¶±üë®üèª! This branch needs to be closed down IMMEDIATELY because there is a abundance of reviews mentioning this same kind of blatant racism‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs disgusting. The women who work here are miserable and self hating individuals and it seems they come to work every day to project their sadness about their lives onto other humans! Get a life or a therapist and don‚Äôt cause racially based trauma to black people just trying to live their lives! What losers‚Ä¶",1,New York,ChIJC6Ccc6hbwokRwhQ6jqnoCU8
12/02/2020 01:45:47,Tysheim Campbell,This branch is horrible. I visited this location to withdraw $1400 out of my account. I was asked questions about my account which I confirmed. I presented my I.D as well as the matching debit card instead I was still profiled by the teller named Nessma Salem. Before my transaction began I was skipped by an elderly Caucasian woman which made me feel uncomfortable but I ignored it. Then when it was my turn I immediately got dirty looks and the teller spoke about my transactions loudly which me super uncomfortable as I did not want the people around me to hear this . I had all the funds available in my account I had all my proper identification but the manager was still called. The manager Yvonne Colley intervene had a private discussion with teller Nessma then immediately took my withdraw deposit form and rudely told me I could not withdraw my money. I was shocked as this is my hard earned money this my account I could t understand . There was no real reason . Then she informed me that I opened it online (again more uncomfortable facts being said out loud to the public) I said yes there is a world wide pandemic why wouldn‚Äôt I been safe months ago and open it online . She rudely continued proceeded to be little me and make feel like a criminal . She shut her office door and took my deposit slip ! I was outraged . Amara Roberson stepped in a thanks to her she spoke with professionalism and deescalated the situation . This was the most embarrassing experience I‚Äôve ever encountered in my life. To be profiled and the out spoken degradation . I am proud African American father and business owner and never in my 33 years of living have every had an experience like this .

03/24/2015 18:18:23,Walt Niedner,"Think of your worst customer service experience ever. With a cable provider? cell phone company? Something like that?

Now multiply the experience by a hundred: the company's incompetence, agent freakout, lack of communication--and stretch that out over a couple of not weeks, not months, but years. 

NOW, layer in the fact that this company has demanded that an aging relative whose husband was tragic taken from her has demanded that she repeatedly provide her husband's death certificate in person--and go through a kind of grieving process each time. Three times now. And today, we learned that again they are claiming that she might have to provide it AGAIN. 

And now the kicker: all of this frustration and grief has been...to change the mailing address on a 529 education savings account for an 8 year old. 

So, in brief: my family's experience with People's United has been, without any doubt, the worst service experience of a lifetime. With so many choices, there's no reason to sign up for this.

It's one thing to not know but the customer service from the teller was unwelcoming and rude.¬† When I asked her to look into it, she agreed but then proceeded to help the bank teller next to her with a task instead of researching the standard details of my account.¬† When I asked if she found anything, she said I would still have to pay the fee.¬† I asked if she even looked into it (which it was apparent she did not bc she was helping the other bank teller) I received zero response and just a blank stare.",2,New York,ChIJIaK3XrxZwokRtmpqSogPBxw

M&T handled the refuted charge awesomely giving me a credit while they investigated. They closed that card in person at the Park Ave Branch. I moved 6 weeks ago. My new address did not include an apt #. I forgot to tell them AND she forgot to ask me what apt # ?
So I added the apt number over the phone and I must return to a branch to order a new card.
Well now I see why people deal with multiple banks. I just don't have the money. With Uber's charge, the banks overdraft charge prevented my Google One from taking $2.00 to pay for my all my digital storage. I was waiting for the new card to arrive. Supposedly I can pay with the acct and routing numbers.

Pete Lim and Richard Parks have been the two assisting and have completely dropped the ball.  The contract they sent me - I questioned the fees and Pete just said oh thats ok, that will change.  I didn't agree with that and made sure to back myself up with an email to him on this. They ordered an appraisal on 10/3 and never followed up until I kept asking because I never received a copy of the appraisal I paid for (I still have not).  After me threatening to dispute the charges, miraculously, they have the appraisal a week out from closing.  They've known when closing was scheduled all along and here we are two days out and they have stated they can't close on time.  My realtor called my Lender, Pete Lim - had him on speaker and he flat out lied to her putting the delay back on me the borrower.  He claimed I did not return the items they asked for timely and they are still waiting on them.  I have the email with everything attached - date/time stamped that I sent them a week ago.  They are completely incompetent and I'm almost at the point of going with a lender since closing is delayed anyways.  They don't deserve my money.

By far worst bank. I'm going to close my account today. Stay away from these guys. They only want your money and will use any shady tactic and even some illegal in alot of states to steal from you.

And spent close to 20000 in a month they place a restriction on the account. Donna advise me that the POA I had was invalid because it was missing statues. AT the same time she contacted Dept of aging where they close the case because nothing was wrong that they saw.The  account has been restricted for 3 months none of his bills could be paid by him which meant I had to pay them for him. Which means He would have to pay me back. Hence why 20000 was from paying me and others where money was borrowed. I got a new POA  with the statures she stated was need it was over 10 days where I decided to call to see if it has been place on the account guess what I was told the POA is no good and they are closing the account on March 20th. To me I feel Donna is a racist and Ill explain my reason 2 people that referred me to this bank spends well over 20000 a month never have they had a problem.

Without any warning, I started getting late notices and phone calls, and my credit score dropped 100 pts.  Reviewing what had happened w/M&T, I was promised this would be addressed and all credit agencies would be notified.  It was a ploy to protect M&T, who blamed the U.S. Post Office for my delay.  Funny, on the day I called them they miraculously ""found"" my payments.

UPDATE. So I received a call setting up an appointment for today.  I show up for an 3rd appointment to be told that the lady I had an appointment with called out sick.

Finally got the attention of a teller despite needing a branch rep to order a card for an account. Finally sat down and after 5 minutes someone asked what I needed and proceeded to tell me they couldn‚Äôt help me but someone would soon. Then after another 5 min someone else came by and stated hello then assumed I was another customers daughter after I retold my request for a third time. Then laughed with the customer she was meeting after she left me loudly about mistaking me. Then 15 min later still no assistance. I finally left as everyone just looked with no ma‚Äôam we can help you or someone will be out soon.

02/13/2013 23:46:38,David Kelly,"My organization opened an account in 1968. I took over as treasurer in 2011 when our treasurer passed away. I was surprised by the fees they charged for our non-profit account that has maintained several thousand dollars with them for decades. When I inquired about the fees they charged for obtaining old statements (which I needed to balance our books) and to obtain cancelled checks, they recommended I get a web account to avoid those fees. The very first month, there was a fee for having a web account. I told them to stick their web account where it doesnt shione and told them that I did not want to pay any fees. They cancelled the web account and went back to a monthly account fee which made me mad as it was, but when they offered a debit card on the account and I got a recent statement, I found that they charge every time you use your debit card to make a purchase, Could I possibly hate this bank any more???

09/01/2023 08:33:51,Richard barrett,This is the worst m & t I've ever banked with. A year ago I tried to cash savings bonds and it was a nightmare. Literally everything that could be messed up was. (I eventually got my money after almost a 3 weeks of waiting) Yesterday I went to deposit cash due to an unforseen bill overdrafting my account.  I deposited 55$ cash and the teller put it in as a check so I was hit with an overdraft fee anyway. So that's fun. Do yourself a favor an drive whatever distance it takes to get to a different branch and AVOID THIS BRANCH AT ALL COSTS!,1,Pennsylvania,ChIJD7VNCGYjxokRbLfoyAQgfww
09/28/2022 15:22:37,Cara Coffroth,"This M&T Bank is by far the worst I've been too. If you go through the drive through, expect a good 20 minute or more wait (even as the 1st person in line) to cash a check or make a deposit. Even when the lot is empty. Also, the speakers are very loud.  So expect that everyone surrounding you will hear any and all of your personal information that they relay to you.  I'd give 0 if I could.",1,Pennsylvania,ChIJD7VNCGYjxokRbLfoyAQgfww

I reported the stolen cards and after there investigations they determine the charges were valid. In there letter that stated I could see the details of the investigation. I have requested the details by phone, mail and certified mail. They completely ignore my request. With most credit cards suspicious charges are denied, this was not the case with this bank. Duplicate charges at Wal-Mart for what appeared to be gift cards were allowed to be purchased over and over. I no longer bank with M&T.

I‚Äôve been there twice for the same thing and left with anger, confusion and a difficult mission both times.  I had to wait for her to come out of her office both times after being screened by the tellers. No smiley, I can help you attitude. I needed a fancy notary stamp and she asked me to practically do the impossible to get one. I tried. I opened an account at another bank... after asking her if I should.  I got a stamp without any problems with the paperwork I had .  She made me feel as if I was trying to STEAL MY OWN MONEY from another institution. It‚Äôs at another bank and I want to put it in Peoples United Bank  My other relatives got their stamps at their banks with less paperwork ..easy!   I will always be stressed and confused about this and won‚Äôt go back. I‚Äôm sure she happy about that.

I get that there are rules.  I don‚Äôt think Sarah knows them!  Or, is it too much energy to find her stamp?  It‚Äôs just a stamp...I had all the paperwork I needed for someone else to stamp it.

I asked if i was able to have a money order for the foreign currency and was told it will come within 7-10 days (within time for my trip). This order came in 2 (TWO) days and i was immediately contacted to pick this up and everything went very smoothly. To really highlight this 5-star experience in my opinion would have to be in regards to the service and kindness of all the tellers (I interacted with 4 of them on two encounters that lasted a total of ~5 minutes each for the foreign currency). I do agree it is frustrating that this bank closes at 4PM and I understand that inconvenience for many based on work hours and other duties. When I visited this site twice in one week, I showed up at 3:58 due to my work hours and I felt like the worst person and very inconvenient to show up right at closing.

The one thing that I didn't like was that it seems you have to go into the branch to open up a savings account which makes it difficult if you work a 9-5.

I had issues with my debit card for days but I called this branch and Betty and Sean took the extra step for me helping me figure out the issue. I couldn't thank them enough for their kindness and professionalism!,5,Virginia,ChIJNYdf4AAUsYkRkUpHp66GonA
12/08/2019 17:35:49,Ian,"This institition is terrible and behind the times. There is no walk up ATM at this branch, but there is a drive up ATM. There is nobody manning the drive up windows at any time of any day, so you will always be forced to use the ATM or get out of your vehicle to talk to a real person. The ATM is regularly out of service here.

Tellers at this branch refused to change my address without a legal document to back up the change, so for several months my bank statements and other sensitive mail was being sent to the wrong address and could not be recovered. When I was finally able to bring in an ""acceptable"" document, one of the tellers at this branch inputted my change of address incorrectly. She was copying it off of my lease, and she clearly didn't double check that she had typed it in correctly. My card was denied every time I had to verify my zip code (online purchases, gas stations, etc) for several months until I figured it out myself.

Last summer the fraud department flagged and locked my card about a dozen times regarding purchases I was personally making that they found suspicious. Customer service agents in the fraud dept were unable or unwilling to be specific regarding why they found my purchases suspicious so that I could have taken steps to prevent this from happening over and over and over. I do know at least one of those times it was due to the tellers refusing to change my address on file.

Good luck to those of you who bank here and get paid on Fridays; it will take 2 to 7 business days (that's almost 2 weeks in real time!) for them to bother verifying a physical paycheck and 1 to 3 business days for them to process a direct deposit. They do not release any part of a paycheck or other type of deposit earlier, like most other banks. Even a cash deposit is typically not available for 24+ hours.

The customer service agents at the 1-800 number are incredibly rude and combative when you can get one to pick up your call. The tellers at this branch are polite and have always been happy to help me, inside of company policy, which brought this review from 1 star to 2 stars.

But I do not recommend banking with Manufacturers and Traders Bank.",2,Virginia,ChIJNYdf4AAUsYkRkUpHp66GonA
02/01/2016 21:54:10,Jack of All Tradez,Tried to open a new checking/savings  account because they sent me a letter asking me to join. It was 4:30 pm on the dot I rushed from work to come in and do this. The lady rushed me right out the door saying the process is long and she couldn't do it at that time now this was exactly 30 mins before closing at 5pm. The attempt was non approachable. I work in customer service with cell phones we activate phones up until the very last minute of closing. And the process is long at times but the customer comes first. Instead of shooting me down as soon as I enter maybe try a more professional attempt. It was a heavy set white woman sitting when you first walk in very rude. I'll continue my banking with Wells Fargo. Had never even heard of this bank until I got this letter in the mail. Wish I could rate this a negative 1!,1,Virginia,ChIJNYdf4AAUsYkRkUpHp66GonA

But when I visited today there were 5 people in line with only one teller was open.
I asked the teller if she was the only one in the bank, she said yes.
I waited and waited.

After fifteen minutes another teller came out from the back room and went to the other teller and started talking about life instead of opening another register.

I waited and waited again, but could not take it anymore when they were all giggling together with the customer.

I have been using the bank for 20 years, but hardly had this kind of poor service.

I asked for a better service, but the lady who came out later said she was having a lunch break.

But what I am saying is if the lunch break is over then go back to your station and start doing the customer service instead of giggling with others.

I had to leave quickly because I had a teaching schedule.

As soon as I tried to transfer a portion of my funds to another bank they froze my account. The fraud dept said the branch people put a hold on it, and the branch people said it was the fraud dept.

M&T failed to contact me or notify me that the check they issued for our property tax had been returned. It wasn‚Äôt till I received a final notice from our courthouse about a possible lean on our first ever home, that I was made aware.

M&T Bank is refusing to take our home loan payments after us doing a forbearance, paying them back, and are trying to force us into foreclosure. All payments were made, and a form was mailed out to us 2 times (which we filled out 2 times and returned) and they claim they have not received it and that is why they wont take our payments. We currently have to hire an attorney to get involved because they admitted to having received our money, but they are not applying it to our principal. They are openly admitting that different representatives of M&T are giving different information about our account. This is not the only HORROR story we have heard about them trying to force families into foreclosure. It is sickening.

I have missed hours from work because they refuse to help me on Saturdays. I have had the branch manager reach tell me she would contact me to make sure I got the correct card, well clearly she never contacted and now refuses to answer my calls. Her along with Jennifer Dove from the bank refuses to talk to me and guess what ??? I still do not have a card that has my correct name on it. I have also been told since I am secondary on the account I can‚Äôt close the account. So now I had to change my deposits and have it go back into the credit Union. Have my inheritance money wired to the credit union.

Had a hard time opening because they send you email saying it's Open but you have to download the app or go on website to login. There's no username or code so how you expect ppl to access they account without knowing that information M&T. Call customer service and they always busy doing absolutely nothing. I know because it took 45min in the early morning hrs and then they place me on hold and a different rep. Pick up asking same old questions as if it's my first time calling.  This happen 3 times and still didn't hear back from anyone. No calls or emails about my banking.  I had 2 complaints in my first 3 days of experience with them and now I have 2 more 3 weeks later.

I opened an account (no bonus) thinking I would use it, deposited 100, and unfortunately forgot about it.

05/26/2023 16:33:23,nayyab nazar,"I would like to share my experience which got at your Reston branch location on Sunset hills road.

I went to deposit money in the branch and teller was really nice and completed my transaction. I requested her if I can see any banker for my loan question and she said to have seat and she will let them know.

There is employee name Drew is sitting on reception, he went inside the office where there was a Lady sitting who was already talking with another employee regarding personal stuff and joking around which I can clearly hear did felt that I am in a branch. Instead of calling me inside, she asked Drew to ask him what he wants though I already informed.

Drew called me and asked my details and I informed him that I forgot to put money in my Checking account and loan was due yesterday, if he can help to force pay or contact anyone in back office if they can do any help. He straight up says that he cannot do anything call employee helpline and tell them to remove your loan from employee marking. I said I am not employee anymore and if you could send request if I will call the later, but if you could help me in reprocessing the loan installment he said no  and contact them. Before leaving I told him that you could have contacted back office to see any guidance on that or help as M&T is known for its customer service which I see nowhere to be seen.

Drew was not welcoming or eager to help neither the other employees sitting in the office. I have been in Maryland branches, VA branches since I left the Bank always best service but was not expecting this from this branch.",1,Virginia,ChIJsRXHSwVItokR0gtusZtR7cg

While doing that she obviously forgot to have us all sign a form we needed, so a week later when I don't have my card, I call in and she tells me we need to sign it. I'm annoyed she didn't have us do it when we were all there and that she didn't contact me about it, I had to track her down. I live an hour away from the bank so this was a massive inconvenience. The rep, knowing she messed up, offer to drop the paperwork off since she lives near me in VA. We were set to meet at 3:30 but I get a call at 3:26 saying she will be 30 minutes late!  I left another meeting to be there on time and she could have let me more than 4 minutes ahead of time. What is worse is that she gets mad at me when I request her to leave it for me to sign as if I did something wrong. She acted like she was doing me a favor when in reality she had already messed up by not having us sign the form in the first place and then missing our appointment.

I went in the branch on Wednesday, August 19, 2021 to initiate a wire transfer. I went up to the teller and she told me I have to schedule that service.

She told me the person that does the wire transfer is not in at the moment, and she was at that point going to let me walk out the door.

Before leaving, I  turned back around to re-approach the teller and asked, ""ok, well how can I schedule a transfer""? She gave me a sticky note to write down my name and phone number, and said she will try her best to get one scheduled for today.  The tone was very nonchalant to the point that it just made the statement unbelieve or that she could care less.

The wire was needed to close on a home.

After I got home, I waited for about one hour and sided with my intuition that no one was going to call me back and instead went to my other bank Chase on MLK to Initiate a wire which took about 15 minutes.

It is now the 23rd and I have yet to get a call back.

I am so glad I did not chose them as a lender to close on the home. It could have been disastrous.

I think at this point I will pull my funds from M&T bank and transfer to Chase, the customer service, lack of staff, and lack of concern at this branch is alarming. I would suggest the current employees be retrained.",1,Washington,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU

05/09/2023 17:19:04,Vanessa Chery,"This branch used to have great in-person and over-the-phone customer service, which is expected because it‚Äôs a small bank. However, it seems they have hired some new staff and there‚Äôs one in particular who has zero patience, zero professionalism in-person or over the phone. This particular employee to my misfortune, is always the one who answers me. She has poor listening skills and is always quick to interrupt customers mid-sentence while speaking to them in an aggravated and condescending tone. She puts customers on hold without informing them of it first, leaving them wondering if she‚Äôs still on the line. On one of several occasions, I had to call the branch to request that they prepare a document for me. In the past, I would request the document over the phone, they would prepare it for me and I would come to pick it up. But on that day, she was of course the one who answered, and after interrupting me several times to reiterate that I needed to come in-person, she placed me on hold without warning. I thought she hung up but waited a few moments; she returned and said it‚Äôs actually okay for me to request the document over-the-phone, which is what I was trying to tell her was done for me in the past all along but she initially refused to listen. It is incredibly frustrating to remain patient with someone who possesses such little ability to listen to and understand others. She has no business handling customers. But anyway, she then said they would get it ready and I could come pick it up right away. When I arrived in-person to pick-up the document (which was 45 minutes after I called the branch), she was also the only teller available to help me. I told her I spoke to her about requesting a document and am here to pick it up. She abruptly responded ‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt know who you spoke to but you‚Äôre going to have to wait because it takes a long time to get it ready. You can come back later or tomorrow .‚Äù At this point, I had no patience to deal with her, but didn‚Äôt want to create a scene, so I just asked how long will it take and chose to wait for it. I don‚Äôt want to share the employee‚Äôs name but she knows who she is. If in the future when I call or visit, her interaction with customers doesn‚Äôt improve, I will just have to report her. I used to love this branch. The older employees are always kind and welcoming. But lately, this particular employee who is always the voice/face I hear/see when I call/visit the branch, is really turning me off. I will not drop her name in the review but I will certainly call M&T Bank and report her. Ruining the bank‚Äôs reputation for great attention to customers.",2,Washington,ChIJb5OUiYnIt4kREyuxxiMHZKA

On Saturday, needing to come into a lobby for service, we found out that appointments are required for Saturdays.  We were at PA Ave branch because it was closest location at that time. This manager provided a polar opposite experience from the Valley Mall branch.  And watched me struggle with my dad for 5 minutes & showed 0 empathy about his wasted trip & difficulties in & out of the car. This was at 10:30am. She had 2 employees present, no customers & 1 appointment there & rudely turned us away. It's not always what you say, & I did understand, it's HOW you say it.  Went to Valley Mall branch just to try our luck.  My 94yo father is in a wheelchair & difficult to get in & out of the vehicle.  I walked in & told MS. KELLY STINE, who was alone & it was now 11:45am, I didn't have an apt but my 94yo father was in the car & could she help us.  She advised typically an apt is required but she would be happy to help us.  When I came back to the bank she personally opened the door for us & ushered us back to her office immediately.  She worked quickly, efficiently & most importantly with empathy for my father's condition & age - she was attentive, friendly & patient with him.  Upon thanking her, she modestly said that M&T's goal is to provide the best customer care & satisfaction.  Ms. STINE exemplifies the kind of gracious representation a bank - who handles people's personal finances - should provide to the public.  THANK YOU MS. STINE for your kind & efficient assistance & resolution.

My car loan was declined and had to pay late fee because they said that account does not belong to me, which is true: He input our names and last names as he wanted...Incorrectly! On top of that, my boss received a message asking for deposit my next payment in to a new bank account... luckily she asked me and of course, it was not me. All this since I went to this branch, and opened an account.

05/09/2023 17:19:04,Vanessa Chery,"This branch used to have great in-person and over-the-phone customer service, which is expected because it‚Äôs a small bank. However, it seems they have hired some new staff and there‚Äôs one in particular who has zero patience, zero professionalism in-person or over the phone. This particular employee to my misfortune, is always the one who answers me. She has poor listening skills and is always quick to interrupt customers mid-sentence while speaking to them in an aggravated and condescending tone. She puts customers on hold without informing them of it first, leaving them wondering if she‚Äôs still on the line. On one of several occasions, I had to call the branch to request that they prepare a document for me. In the past, I would request the document over the phone, they would prepare it for me and I would come to pick it up. But on that day, she was of course the one who answered, and after interrupting me several times to reiterate that I needed to come in-person, she placed me on hold without warning. I thought she hung up but waited a few moments; she returned and said it‚Äôs actually okay for me to request the document over-the-phone, which is what I was trying to tell her was done for me in the past all along but she initially refused to listen. It is incredibly frustrating to remain patient with someone who possesses such little ability to listen to and understand others. She has no business handling customers. But anyway, she then said they would get it ready and I could come pick it up right away. When I arrived in-person to pick-up the document (which was 45 minutes after I called the branch), she was also the only teller available to help me. I told her I spoke to her about requesting a document and am here to pick it up. She abruptly responded ‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt know who you spoke to but you‚Äôre going to have to wait because it takes a long time to get it ready. You can come back later or tomorrow .‚Äù At this point, I had no patience to deal with her, but didn‚Äôt want to create a scene, so I just asked how long will it take and chose to wait for it. I don‚Äôt want to share the employee‚Äôs name but she knows who she is. If in the future when I call or visit, her interaction with customers doesn‚Äôt improve, I will just have to report her. I used to love this branch. The older employees are always kind and welcoming. But lately, this particular employee who is always the voice/face I hear/see when I call/visit the branch, is really turning me off. I will not drop her name in the review but I will certainly call M&T Bank and report her.

I left another meeting to be there on time and she could have let me more than 4 minutes ahead of time.

08/23/2021 17:14:40,Fillip Nelson,"I'm am not sure to blame this situation on the bank M&T itself for lack of training, or if this is something that falls on the branch.

I went in the branch on Wednesday, August 19, 2021 to initiate a wire transfer. I went up to the teller and she told me I have to schedule that service.

She told me the person that does the wire transfer is not in at the moment, and she was at that point going to let me walk out the door.

Before leaving, I  turned back around to re-approach the teller and asked, ""ok, well how can I schedule a transfer""? She gave me a sticky note to write down my name and phone number, and said she will try her best to get one scheduled for today.  The tone was very nonchalant to the point that it just made the statement unbelieve or that she could care less.

The wire was needed to close on a home.

After I got home, I waited for about one hour and sided with my intuition that no one was going to call me back and instead went to my other bank Chase on MLK to Initiate a wire which took about 15 minutes.

It is now the 23rd and I have yet to get a call back.

I am so glad I did not chose them as a lender to close on the home. It could have been disastrous.

I think at this point I will pull my funds from M&T bank and transfer to Chase, the customer service, lack of staff, and lack of concern at this branch is alarming. I would suggest the current employees be retrained.",1,District of Columbia,ChIJAzju86C5t4kRp_Ufu7D1RXU

I went into to do a wire and I had to wait more than an hour because the branch is disorganized and they don't even bother checking on you if the wait is long.  The staff isn't adequately trained either.  This is really the responsibility of the bank at large and its regional manager.   It's ran so poorly I'm embarassed to admit that I bank here.
