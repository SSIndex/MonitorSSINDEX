08/14/2018 22:34:13,Blunt Truth,"Worse banking experience ever. The Bank has an online and app to help you keep accurate balances. They appear so accurate, showing pending items and balance adjustments. However, they are not accurate, do not reflect in any way accuracy and are used as a tool by the bank to extort fees. When I asked a manager about why the online or app gives an inaccurate balance I was rudely told that I should use a pen and a ledger. Wow. Really? How about a stone tablet and chisel? I have heard many negative experiences with this bank yet this was my first, and my last. Pass. Bank elsewhere, where you can trust your bank to move forward with honesty and integrity instead of scamming with false information online and in their app. Not Backwards and blame the customer for their lack of transparency in their technology. This was not a ""fluke"". I was warned about shady fees - I guess it was just my turn to get screwed by a poorly management cooperation. They will intentionally try to confuse you when confronted. Too bad, everyone isn't as stupid as they would like to assume.",1,Alabama,ChIJxWJQog0OmogR1n2AFt8Jfv0

I have never been so disrespected while trying to give a bank more of my money that they could use which is one of the main points of a banks existence.
Luckily the citizens Bank in Albertville was able to handle my banking needs quickly and efficiently like you expect a bank to do, but as for this disabled veteran I will never recommend the branch in Cullman to anyone.",1,Alabama,ChIJdakOmcDLiYgRNHMgZk-qvU0

The folks here at the bank are all as nice as they can be, they all know me by first name as well. A good small-town bank that I am very happy to have an account with~",5,Alabama,ChIJr6ell_XIh4gRMvwVYQm13Lo
11/15/2018 23:28:54,Sweet Home Alamanda,"Wow...unsure of who the ""friendly dark-haired lady"" was that apparently thought that ME- a white, blonde-headed woman in a Honda was a terrorist ready to break into your ""old hat"" bank in the morning as they opened. I live almost 2 hours from here, and once per month I drive a long way to have an appointment at a nearby salon...so near you can see it from the bank. I arrived early and they were mowing and weed eating all around the parking lot to the salon which wasn't open yet, so I parked at the nearby bank at 7:30 in an area where other cars were parked and it had a covering overhead, which helped with the sun, and I also used the space at the end- the furtherest parking space from the door. Well, when the employees started coming in there was one lady that wouldn't stop staring me down as if I were a member of Al Qaeda waiting to rush in and rob the bank, and looking at me extremely rude. She stared me down all the way until she got to the door to unlock it and then just stood there with the door open staring at me more (smart thing to do if you think there's a security risk going on). I didn't think much of it because I was minding my own business and eating a biscuit and looking down at my phone most of the time. But then I look up again and she had an entire clan of people looking at me (employees who had arrived and were standing outside of their cars in the parking lot); she was looking at them in the parking lot as if they shouldn't try to walk into the bank because me, *the possible big bad mean bank robber* might try to rush them. I'm a person sitting here waiting for a business to open and I've actually sat in the same exact parking spot 5-6 times before without any issue. Once I realized what was going on I saw a man walking over to my car and I rolled down my window, and I explained to him what I was doing and that after using THEIR ATM I was just waiting on a business to open. He then said that they just weren't sure what I was up to.

I will say, just based on this incident I am so glad I am not a customer of your bank. I understand having to have security, but this isn't it. I don't know what happened to small town courtesy, hospitality and friendliness but it certainly doesn't reside here. I used your ATM, but that's one fee you'll never get from me again.",1,Alabama,ChIJr6ell_XIh4gRMvwVYQm13Lo

03/01/2024 18:06:13,Jesse Hamilton,"Literally walked in to open an account with this institution. I asked for a manager due to having a large amount of money to deposit. Instead, this snide, condescending woman comes out, no introduction, no handshake, just sits down and says ""what do you want?"" I proceed to tell her that we have done business with other local banks and they seem to get freaked out whenever we want to pull out a few thousand dollars worth of cash to pay contractors for work on our house and asked will this institution have the same problem?
She just smirks and says ""I don't think this bank and you will be a good fit"". I just laughed at her hysterically, showed her the check for $300,000 I was going to deposit and walked out.

I will NEVER do business with any Alabama bank ever again. Congrats to CB&T on being a second rate bank. Best to take your money and business elsewhere.",1,Alabama,ChIJFw5COtT4iYgRQZMQXqm5lYs

I was okay well I'll take it up front and they will cash it for you. It took them 5 more minutes for them to come and verify my name at which time I just asked for my check back.

Each of the tellers have become friends over the years.  My children were babies when we first became customers and they each took time to talk with my children and make them feel at home while I was in the bank.  They made them feel so at home that they had no trouble when it came time to open their own accounts.
I have made the comment before that if I were to move to another state I would still use Citizens Bank & Trust.  It is worth it to have someone who treats you like family.",5,Alabama,ChIJNf-1vpzmiYgRrPLTHN-b_5w

Communication between their back office (underwriting) and branch bankers are bad. Showed up to an appointment just for the branch to tell me they had no idea what I was talking about nor did they have a loan closing in place nor did the loan processor I spoke with for a week straight never (forgot) submitted my application. This should have been apped and closed within 2 days at most! Wont be surprised to hear about this banking failing. Big bank gonna take little bank soon.,1,Arizona,ChIJLSdjixWrK4cRcZ5jyjMx_TA

09/29/2023 18:30:01,Todd Weber,This would be a good bank but they do not pay. Hardly any interest on accounts. There are banks around that are paying 4% of checking accounts interest. My savings account was drawing 00.1% that's not being competitive at all and when I called them about it all they had to say was sorry but they couldn't touch any of the interest rates that other banks around. Could I mean what's the point in having your money in a bank where they are making big interest off you and keeping the money or going to another bank less than a mile away? That will give you 4% on a checking account. It's just not good math people. This bank either needs to get competitive or sell out because they are definitely not competitive and the bank app is the worst I've ever seen. Sorry for the bad rap but it is what it is. Take your money elsewhere. Let your money work for you. Not set there and get stagnant money is too precious these days,1,Arkansas,ChIJ6-rNkfba04cRVx82MXoXYQM
12/20/2023 18:30:46,Anthony Farr,"Hello. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS BANK. Unfortunately I was referred to this bank through a CPAC FINANCE , the preferred finance company for Schneider Trucks. Be aware that you can find your own finance company. You do not have to use Schneider‚Äôs preferred partner because they are only a broker which amounts to terrible customer services and probably more fees. Anyhow, CPAC Financial tells me that I‚Äôm approved, I agree to the terms and after I‚Äôve agreed they decide to tell me that my approval is with THE CITIZENS BANK. I send THE CITIZENS BANK a wire for $35,000 as a deposit to my semi truck. May not be a lot to the bank but it was for me and my family. Next I receive a call from a gentleman by the name of MICHAEL CHILDRESS. MICHAEL CHIDRESS is my assigned loan officer. He discussed the terms of the loan with me and I did agree. Mr. Childress advised that my loan date would start 2 days later on 10-25-23. I expressed concern with this being that I did not have a title nor did I have any documentation to register my truck and have any use of the vehicle. Mr. CHIDRESS told me verbatim that the title will be mailed to ME overnight . I sign and agree to the terms.
Turns out Mr. CHIDRESS intentionally withheld information from me. The title is NOT mailed to me. It is mailed to their title company who then has to mail the title to my states DMV office. This is a 2 week minimum process that Mr. Childress is very aware of and could have been honest enough to explain to me. Instead he has not been in his office or on vacation ever since.
I simply asked this bank to make my payment date reflective of or about the time that I actually had the opportunity to register and use the vehicle. Instead what I got was no return phone calls, phone hung up on my face and eventually received a delay in the first ACH which defeated the purpose. Now instead of having to make a payment 2 weeks after receiving the ok to register, I have to make 2 payments at 2 weeks apart.
It simply is bad business that Schneider recommends broker, that recommends a bank and you or your services are not these guys concern. They simply herd you along and care nothing about you and it shows. Just a little common courtesy goes a long way and if they couldn‚Äôt delay the payment date on a continuous basis then at least explain to the consumer fully and let the consumer make the decision. I would have rather took  my business elsewhere and I would recommend anyone to do the same. Micheal CHIDRESS has been placed in a position to represent this bank and it is clear that he cares nothing about building relationships built on honesty and integrity. He simply will say anything to get you to agree and once before the paperwork is dry he could care less how you walk away feeling about the transaction you made. DO NOT TRUST THIS BANK.",1,Arkansas,ChIJ6-rNkfba04cRVx82MXoXYQM

I just happen to stumble upon this on Saturday, July 1st, as I logged her in to help her pay her bills.  This has created havoc getting another bank account open and contacting her utility companies about late payments this month, not to mention the added expenses of the incurred late-fees.  Very poor communication and worse the treatment of a 30+ year customer of your bank.  I would defintely take a look a any other bank, before opening an account here.  On the bright side, we did manage to find another banking instituion , actually several local banks, with much better perks then what was being offered here.  So not all is lost...

09/08/2018 15:47:14,Sheldon E,"First Citizens bought out my bank‚Äôs loans from FDIC for pennies on the dollar in 2009 when banks were crumbling.  Profiting millions. My loan was a construction loan that was complete but not converted to conventional loan yet.

First Citizens refused to refinance the loan and would only keep it as a home equity loan that was closed to draw upon.  Since it was a ‚Äúhome equity‚Äù loan in their status, it allowed them to apply ballon payment demands once the term hit.  During this recession no banks were doing jumbo refinancing so First Citizens tried to steal my house from me because of the equity it had.

This bank only wants your deposits and to use and suck the life out of anyone they can get.  Since they‚Äôre based out of NC, no one in any branch has a clue what is going on or how to do anything.

10/17/2023 19:33:18,Capri Brock,"My experience at First Citizens has undoubtedly surpassed any prior banking experiences. I highly recommend First Citizens to those seeking a banking institution that offers an exceptional and genuinely gratifying customer journey. The level of service and personal attention provided underscores First Citizens' commitment to ensuring a truly outstanding banking experience.

I have encountered many challenges with various financial institutions in the past, where discrepancies between promises made and actions taken were unfortunately commonplace. It often seemed as though these entities were primarily focused on acquiring new account holders, utilizing persuasive rhetoric to encourage sign-ups, only to fall short of their commitments once the account was established. Consequently, I found myself disillusioned and burdened as a consumer.

My friend recommended I take a look at First Citizens, as her experience had far surpassed any and all of her expectations. Intrigued by the assurance of integrity and adherence to promises, I decided to transition my banking experience to this institution. To my immense satisfaction, this decision has proven exceptionally worthwhile.

The entirety of the First Citizens team has consistently demonstrated exceptional professionalism and a notable ease of collaboration. Beyond the standard banking relationship, First Citizens also has a personalized touch, you aren't merely an account holder but a recognized individual upon entering their bank. The staff exhibits a remarkable ability to recall personal details from previous interactions, with a special mention to Jenny, whose smile and demeanor always leave a lasting positive impression. I used to dread bank errands and now I look forward to them -- because I know I will be met with a friendly face and expectations met",5,Colorado,ChIJXbgqk1aGbIcRPTef5ER2o9k

07/24/2023 21:48:51,Karen Martiz,"I recently had the pleasure of working with First Citizen Bank for a business loan, and I must say, it was an incredibly smooth and easy process from start to finish! I cannot praise them enough for the exceptional service they provided, making me feel comfortable and supported throughout the entire journey.

From the moment I reached out to First Citizen Bank, I was assigned to a loan officer named Odane. Right from our first conversation, it was evident that Odane was committed to understanding my business needs and finding the best loan solution tailored to my specific requirements. He went above and beyond to ensure that I felt confident and informed throughout the lending process.

Communication with Odane was a breeze. He was always fast in responding to my questions, and he patiently addressed all my questions and concerns. What impressed me the most was his willingness to guide me through every step, holding my hand and providing valuable insights to make the right decisions for my business.

First Citizen Bank's dedication to understanding my business needs was truly commendable. Odane took the time to dive deep into my business model, revenue streams, and future plans. This level of attention allowed him to present me with a loan offer that was not only the best for my business but also convenient for me in terms of repayment and other terms.

Apart from the excellent service and personalized approach, I was thrilled to learn that First Citizen Bank has an outstanding reputation for business loans. It reaffirmed my trust in their expertise and ability to support businesses like mine.

Overall, my experience with First Citizen Bank and Odane was fantastic. They made what can often be a stressful process, such as securing a business loan, into a seamless and even enjoyable experience.

Use the citizens bank branch locator on their website to find a nearby location. The only thing ""near"" the Orlando area would be an ATM in Deltona. As for branches, the representative mentioned ones in Miami and FT Lauderdale. I have submitted for this location to be removed so it does not confuse people in the future.

12/03/2023 01:57:35,Arthur Prescott,"Update!! For the record. The check was not fraudulent. Racist manager/president this does not have a good look for you!!

I have banked with CBT for 6 years now. My wife and I are closing our accounts immediately. On 1/21/23, I went to CBT Trenton to deposit a government issued check for approximately 4,000 and a couple other checks. I understood the clerk needs assistance to verify my check.

The manager at the moment explained to me that he believed this check was fake due to the high volume of fake checks recently, he insisted on seeing the documentation included with the check, which I produced. After all this the manager told me I would be prosecuted when the check comes back fake after 7 days.

I have not received an apology even if this is a miscommunication. The reason is most likely because this manager is still waiting after 7 days for the check to clear or not. Well when it clears, I will have this manager help clean out my accounts

Matthew 18:15-18

15 If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
16 But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

06/01/2023 23:39:57,Beth Fowler,"I simply went to open an account.  The older lady that I was told to go to did not only not want to help me but did everything to stop me from doing so. I got to the bank at 3:30 they close at 4 in Thursdays.  Before I even sat down she says ""opening a new account will take an hour can you come back tomorrow? We close at 4 and I have somewhere to be."" I told her no as I work tomorrow she then asked if I could come back Saturday. Again I told her no. She then seemed very put out rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed like I was bothering her.

My mom came to open the account with me as I wanted her on it. She then was all ""we have to run a credit report. I have to make sure an officer is going to be here. To which she came back and then said ""he wasn't going to be here but he said he would stay.""

When she then took my check looked at it and said ""we have to hold this for 5 days before we can do anything""

At this point where all of this would have been fine I didn't appreciate the attitude. After being told ""I have somewhere to be."" the 7th time I was done. so I decided to take my business accounts elseware.",1,Georgia,ChIJl9mKcK1OYIgRQ1zQzyo-Ymc

06/10/2023 13:43:35,Yvonne Pippin,"I have been a customer of First Citizens for 5 years. When I moved to ATL three years ago, this was my closest bank. A few months ago I got married. I came into this branch to change my name on my checking account and credit card.  They told me they would send new cards with my new name. A few days later, I got the cards with my maiden name and the same card numbers. I went into the branch. They were confused about why that happened and tried again, this time expediting the cards. A day later I got the cards, again with my maiden name and same card number. I opened my bank app n realized I had been charged $35 for the expedited fees. I returned to the bank n they had no idea what happened or why I was charged and not them. They tried to issue new cards n refund my fees. This happened FOUR times. They kept charging my account n sending additional cards. I called corporate and they couldn't help me, told me to go back into the branch. Finally after 4 tries, and hours in the office waiting and on the phone, they sent me cards with my correct name. When I went to activate the credit card, I noticed my account was closed. I called and was informed they thought they had to close my account and open a new one to get my new name on a card. This credit card has rewards on it. Also, they had not refunded the expedited fees. And as well I had returned some online purchases and they went back on the closed card. My credit score immediately plummeted and when I called, they were powerless to refund any money. Essentially they have stolen over $300 from me in returns, fees and rewards. No one will help and they keep saying they can do Nothing.  Corporate tells me to go to the branch. In addition, I started a new job and would need to take off work to go to this branch and talk to them, in vain as they act helpless. I plan to drive to a different branch n close my checking account on a weekend. I will be telling everyone to avoid first citizens.  They lost a loyal customer from their gross incompetence and thievery.",1,Georgia,ChIJYbuOeEAQ9YgRK33LAs6vVjA

09/26/2022 15:15:12,Keisha Fowler,"Some of the staff seems a bit incompetent . Visited this branch on two different occasions to handle some things for my business account. Both times I was told wrong information and turned away. The second time is what really vexed me. I needed to deposit a business check. Unfortunately, the issuer of the check listed my business name incorrectly; it was issued to ""business name INC"" instead of ""business name LLC."" They would not accept the check. I even called the home branch where I opened my account (and whose staff knew me VERY well) to verify myself and my business but the teller at this branch still would not accept it. I let her know that not depositing the check would inconvenience my client and that I flew into Atlanta specifically to transact business with the particular business check for a particular client. The teller did not care; she made no attempt to help or oblige me- not checking with a manager to see if she could do anything- nothing. Interestingly enough, for the both times I went to this branch to transact business and was told the wrong thing, I'd go to another branch and they'd oblige me with no problem. I love banking with First Citizens Bank without a doubt. But the people at this branch let their incompetence and lack of desire to actually work for their customers benefit- lead.

04/05/2024 14:58:06,LeAndre Fiori,"It is with great sorrow that I make this comment. Because I have been a client of First Citizens Bank for several years now. However, in recent times, it feels as though they‚Äôve lost respect for clients, who have entrusts them with the safety of their hard earned money.

On March 27th, 2024, this institution, let Hertz withdraw $1,567.44 that wasn‚Äôt owed to them, in any way, shape, form, or fashion. Sadly, this isn‚Äôt the first time First Citizens Bank has allowed such a thing to happen with my account.

I was renting from Hertz for the Uber program. I authorized them to take a weekly rental amount of $345. And this has been the routine for the past Six months, give or take. But, out of the blue, Hertz requested $1,567.44, and that didn‚Äôt raise any red flags with anyone at First Citizens Bank. No one at this institution bothered, or cared enough to give me a call and inform me of a suspicious amount being charged to my card. I didn‚Äôt even have this amount in my account, which put me at a negative $600 plus. And I was not able to pay my rent this month.

Hackers, why bother stealing someone‚Äôs identity when banks will just hand over their client‚Äôs money without hesitation?

The funny thing about this, is that, First Citizens has all of my financial records. Therefore, they knew that I was not delinquent in any payments to Hertz.

It took minutes for this institution to aid and abet Hertz in the theft of my money. However, they‚Äôre telling me that it‚Äôs going to take 7-10 business days for them to get my money back into my account‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs if everything goes well SMH

Beautiful people, do what you want. But, in my opinion, this institution can‚Äôt be trusted with the safety of your money.",1,Georgia,ChIJMUiRdX-q9YgRrJAnwaBfCjQ

I drove up requested a checking deposit ticket. The young girl - Erica at the window asked me if I was at the right bank. And informed me that this this was Citizens Bank of Edinburg - As if the large sign outside didn‚Äôt give a hint as to where I was. Anyway, I told her I had banked there for almost 40 years and asked why she would question my deposit. She said ‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt recognize you‚Äù. Then she told me I probably wanted National Citizens Bank - which doesn‚Äôt exist. I then asked why in God‚Äôs name would I drive out of my way to a small town to put a large sum of money in a bank where I have no account? She did not answer but walked away and finally finished the transaction. I didn‚Äôt know Erica had to know you to bank here. I didn‚Äôt get the memo, the secret handshake or password.

They said, and I qoute, If we find out he is using it we will shut them off. Hmm, really. Then I get a call the same afternoon from another employee at the main branch who advises me because it is ""in his possession"" it has to be shut off and they WILL NOT issue another debit card on the account, ever. So if I was shopping and left it in his vehicle, thats posession and you are going to turn off my cards and not issue new ones? She then proceeded to say well let me talk to the manager and I will call you back. Don't bother, I will be there to close all three accounts and go somewhere else.

They are sooo far behind in technology that even though we have a consumer loan through them we can't pay by phone without having a deposit account????

They have been very professional and helpful, especially in helping me change my accounts around after my husband died 2 years ago.  Most recently I opened a checking account for a non-profit organization, after another bank in town gave me the third degree just to change signers on an existing account, and after 3 weeks still wanted more information before they would approve it.

01/27/2018 04:50:14,Larry Denger,"If I could give them a ZERO STAR, it would be too much for these liars.  Maybe you're thinking as bad as Wells Fargo or Bank or America?  Worse!  Let me tell you about my last three weeks of Hell, over two of which I was on vacation in Hawaii.  Three weeks ago, I get a call fraud was suspected on my debit card by an out of state charger as reported by Shazam.  That was a correct assumption and a bank teller contacted me with the news.  I told the teller I was leaving for HI in 3 days, and asked if they could overnight or at least sent Priority Mail the new card.  Since the teller stated it took ""5-7 business days for a new card to be delivered"",  I was well within my time frame to have the card while I was in HI.  The teller said the bank ""would in NO WAY send Express or Priority Mail my new debit card.""  I repeated/reminded her words of 5-7 business days for a new card to be delivered.  Two hours later/same day, another person called me from the bank and again went over the details of the debit card breach, and the bank's proposal of downloading my next pay check (in 4 days, the day after I left for HI).  They would load that paycheck (4 figures) onto a prepaid credit card and put it in the mail (no Express or Priority Mail delivery).  That was their best offer!
Eleven days after I left my first location on Hawaii, there was no debit card.  In fact, a person I spoke to at the bank relayed to me the card had been sent eight (8) days prior, well within the 5-7 business days of time in order to reach me.  Because I hadn't received the card yet, First Citizens now went on attack mode and blamed me/the US Postal Service, the Hawaiian People, Zeus, Budha, Christ and anyone else they could throw in the mix.  Three weeks later, I am still without a debit card and no way to access 4 figures of funds in my account with First Citizens.  Is this the kind of bank you want to have to back you up when you need theeir help?  Think about it...",1,Iowa,ChIJQ2CKN-T18YcR1r81TJzOeio

I've opened an account at a Credit Union and plan on slowly moving my money to it. Sad because I've been banking at this location (almost 20 yrs) since it was Versus. I refused to be demeaned by someone who clearly doesn't know what customer service is.

Regarding the reply, no one from this bank has tried to call me about this review. I have no idea what they're talking about. I should have left this review much sooner, but life happens. It wouldn't have been so bad if the woman apologized. However, she just likes to give an attitude. (Multiple times regarding the issue I had at the time)",1,Kansas,ChIJA1Sd7kbjuocRroCaCflZBs4

Wrong password or missed a letter or number twice? Well then YOURE LOCKED OUT. Poor wording of username/access id, unable to reset account via app. Other banks have better mobile applications where you can reset your account without a statement in front of you. 2024 update: New app is better than old one, but reply from bank was rude at best, could use someone who went to college to review their work on proper grammar. First mentioning something about overdraft, which was not relevant to my comment, then downplaying the feedback they received and misdirecting using words like cumbersome, how about just taking feedback saying thanks and improving from there? Douglass location better than Derby locations. Girls at douglass location are great and friendly. Douglass location is 4/5 parking could be improved otherwise great service.

The guy that I was speaking to told me normally they wouldn't mind staying a little bit over but they had the trunk or treat tonight for the community so they really needed to get out of there on time tonight. I understood I said all right I'll have to come in the morning and get it done and I said it kind of sucks not having my card I understand my fault I lost my card.

01/17/2024 19:57:05,Cranked Up Confections,"Citizens Bank of Kansas uses the motto ""Banking isn't a Money business... it's a People business.""

I find this statement to be an absolute joke.

On December 17, 2023, my husband went to Best Buy on Maize Road in Wichita to buy our teen son an Apple Play Radio and a back up camera for his truck and have them do the installation as a Christmas gift. They took our money UP FRONT and set up the installation for December 30, 2023.

On December 30, as he was walking out the door to go to the installation with our son, Best Buy left a message they had no technicians available and needed to reschedule the appointment. We tried calling back multiple times over the next several days only to discover you cannot actually speak with anyone in store and are talking to foreign customer service reps who could not get us rescheduled.  We were told numerous times they would leave a message for someone to call us back, which never happened.  We even got emails canceling parts that were ordered for the installation that had been paid for as part of his gift.

We filed a dispute with Citizens Bank because we were out of $585.83 for this gift. They required us to shut off the card in order to file the dispute (which is a policy only Citizens has). I have asked multiple times at the branch who is handling this and why we did not have a provision credit yet. No one seems to know who was working on it. I went to the branch in person today and was informed that we will NOT get a provisions credit and this matter can now take 90 days to get resolved.

THIS IS NOT OKAY! This is our sons gift and we don‚Äôt have an extra $585.83 laying around to go elsewhere while Best Buy has our money for services they did not perform.

Now we also get a notified via email from Best Buy they tried to refund only a small part of the order (for $123.60) TO THE CARD THAT IS NOW OFF because of Citizens Bank Policy and we have no clue if we will ever see that in our account.

Needless to say we are looking into other banks because for Citizens not to protect their own customers is absolutely not acceptable.",1,Kansas,ChIJRdPmPimZpYcRCtENiqbpKYE

Called about a one time curtesy of waiving a returned check charged, while my account is always in good standing. The first lady at drive thru told me it was no problem and someone would call me the next day. No one called me back the next day, as I was verbally told and confirmed before leaving.   Upon calling no one answered main location, was transferred and told it was up to location I opened account with. Spoke with Kelly Bruckman who told me she would not help, and that they would rather lose a member than waive a $28 fee. I'll be communicating this to my family who also have larger accounts here. This banks mobile application is trash by the way. Once it updates it never saves your password for IOS, you always have to type it in.

I do like the fact they are community oriented and local. I like the over-draft protection, even though I dont use it. But the fact, a bank this small can cover an overdraft for a customer but charge me $20 for bank statement reprints is outrageous. I had a bank statement printed a few weeks prior and was never charged or informed of a charge, but somehow now, there is a fee.

I called them in Mid July and noone reached to me after so many voicemail.
After so many call, they replied saying they don‚Äôt have my mailing address. They blamed me for not having my address while opening the account. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Later they said we send you a mail but it got return back to them. Is it all story to get easy money from your customer? They charged me for consecutive 3 months. They didn‚Äôt even send me an email for once. I asked them to return back the amount which was charged and they totally blame me for everything. I hope you enjoy my money and make most out of it.

09/22/2018 18:50:50,James Wicks,"Whew don't do business with this bank. I had deposited a check on Thursday 5pm at the Covington Branch, I got frustrated when I found out funds wouldn't be available til Saturday. I read on their policy that $200 would be made available the First Business Day so I stopped by with the policy in hand and was immediately met by anger.

A older woman with thicker glasses and blonde hair went off the rails immediately when I was just trying to figure out what their definition of First Business day meant. I thought first business day was the day of the deposit, and second Business day was the next day after the initial date of deposit.

She screamed at me in front of other customers, because i said this seemed shady, I wasn't yelling I wasn't being aggressive I was just letting a comment on what was going on come out. I served 8 years in the US Army in Civil Affairs I don't scream at civilians when they get aggressive because I know they may be acting in the moment. She immediately said ""I want you to come in tomorrow and close your bank account we will not do business with you anymore"" I hadn't yelled I hadn't done anything wrong expect drop a butterscotch on the ground when I opened up the wrapper but I cleaned it up. I will say I would be writing a report to appropriate officers in the state to let them know how they reacted and how I couldn't understand their policy. She continued to scream at me after I said that as I left the business, her still shouting at me as the doors closed.

That is fine, I will go to Navy Federal, a respected national bank that takes care of veterans. But I will also be writing my report to the appropriate offices and discouraging anyone I can from doing business with CBT. There are tons of other Great national and local options to make it easier for you to bank. Don't give your money to these people....

If you check the reviews I think this was the same lady that screamed at the nice woman that was at the Abita Cafe.

Update! They will close your account without giving you notice! Woke up this morning the day after the above happened and find out my debit card is shut off, my checks don't work, but hey! the money is in the account thank you online access.",1,Louisiana,ChIJEeM7UP5eJ4YR2IjBUE4g8dA

Kyle answered all of my questions in a matter of minutes and was available at all hours when I needed any clarity.

I submitted the online app which it turns out was an utter waste of time because the folks processing the loan can‚Äôt see the data. In the course of 4+ months I had to send multiple copies of the same forms, communication back and forth was dismal throughout the process. When we finally reached closing, I the customer, had to call my current mortgage company to get the pay offs despite being told they had open lines of communications with the current lender. I showed up to closing that had been pushed back unbeknownst to us. We eventually signed paperwork only to find out Citizens had not sent over all the docs so we had to make more arrangements to finalize. One would think if you spent 10k in closing costs that the customer wouldn‚Äôt have to hand-hold to this extent.

She is great with every customer I send to her and always makes them feel like family and not just another number or paycheck. I have been in the automobile business for the past 17 years and rarely do we find many bankers that have a heart and care for their customers like she does.
On a personal level First Citizens, Andrea and Mike have been great to work with! I have personal and business accounts set up with them. First Citizens and Andrea went above and beyond to make my dreams come true in financing me with my own Dealership.  Without there hard work and hours of working to get you the best rates or deal I wouldn't be where I am at.
Anyone can go to an establishment (bank or credit union) and cash a check or have a checking or savings account but when you go into First Citizens you feel like your family. Everyone is always in a positive attitude with smiles on their faces. If you are looking for a hometown feeling or family atmosphere please give them a shot.

08/05/2019 03:52:07,Tom Douglas,We have had this bank for over 3 years and have had alot of problems. The app and website randomly go down and the debit cards have randomly stoped working. They dont send any notifications when this happens. It is so embracing when you are shopping and go to pay and your cards are declined and have to just leave because your cards are down and all they say is sorry we are trying to get everything back up and say it should work by the end of the day. You would figure that they would figure out why this keeps happening and fix it but they dont. The app is currently down now and since it's a sunday there's nothing we can do if we needed to transfer money.

Plus I have received several security alert messages saying that invalid logins were used on my account when I would not have been trying to access my own account.

When it was my turn she help me with one thing before someone she recognized came in then she passed me on to the other person to open a CD who saw me sitting there the whole time.  I asked if she could also help with a few other items.  I ended up just closing the account and had to wait for the original teller to do that.  The amount was large enough that the bank I went to was more than happy to help me.  So much for southern hospitality.  They never asked why I had decided to close it.   It was that obvious.

I called them a couple of weeks ago, needed a routing number for my escrow check to be wired to our account.  Very rude person over the phone, condescending, I made the mistake of calling them CITI bank... I could almost see her nose in the air when she corrected me. I racked it up to the change of name etc.

I have been stuck in California for medical reasons. Today is the first day I could physically get to the bank.  I was there prior to their 10 am opening time.  I didn‚Äôt know you needed an appointment to go in, that info should be posted where their hours are on google and on their website.

Again, a rude employee came out to ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù it‚Äôs getting close to 100 degrees outside.  She asked if I had an appointment, no, didn‚Äôt know I needed one to get into the bank which has my money. I gave her a brief outline of what I needed, she said she would call me-and that her 10 o‚Äôclock appointment was waiting behind me.  I told her ‚Äúhere, let me give you my name & phone #‚Äù... how would she have contacted me if I hadn‚Äôt?

03/02/2018 06:36:07,John Milligan,"I have been into this particular branch about a dozen times in the past and I've worn a hat probably more times than not. I conducted my business without any concern until today when a young lady insisted that I remove my hat before she would help me. There was an older gentleman standing right next to me who was also wearing a hat, however, for whatever reason the lady didn't seem to care and did not ask him to remove his hat(I asked him on the way out the door)... This was rather irritating because if you're going to tell one person to remove their hat you better tell EVERYONE to remove their hat every time they enter the building or you could be facing a lawsuit. I refused to do so and opted instead to go to the drive through to complete my transaction. After it was finished I asked to speak with a supervisor and I was ignored so I walked back into the bank and expressed my feelings to the tellers at the counter. When the exchange was complete an older gentleman (also wearing a hat)standing behind me said ""amen to that"". The tellers actually called the owner of the account that I deposited money into, told them about the incident, and threatened to ban me from the location. Sounds like someone was embarrassed. According to one teller it was the banks ""policy"" that you can't wear hats, hoods or sunglasses into the bank. You as a customer are suspicious and are required to adhere to some inane dress code because it will somehow foil a robbery. I'll bet a million dollars that they wouldn't dare ask a Muslim woman to remove her Hijab, yet, requiring a young man to remove his hat before you help him is standard operating procedure.",1,New Mexico,ChIJ0Yr7CQ55PIcRs7OKgBVHSnw
07/29/2020 16:56:18,Envy Gul D' Cryso,"I have aging grandparents who bank here and I don't live nearby, it has proven to be impossible to help them through online banking.  I even went into the branch with my grandfather to get face-to-face recognition/report when I went down for a visit; it has shown to be useless as I am still given the run around constantly.  Trying to navigate and explain this bank's processes and/or procedures is, for lack of a better term, rage inducing.  In order to set up the online banking you have to submit a request to do so, inputting all of the matching data from SSN's, Last Deposit and even a code word that they verbally set up with the bank; then, IF it is approved you have to get a six digit access code when you log in.  That wouldn't be a problem if they (grandparents) had a mobile phone with which to relay it or if they simply understood the call they were receiving in order to give me the code; which after multiple calls it is clear that they do not.  Additionally, even knowing this, the person I spoke to face to face can't/won't help by simply adding my phone number as an alternate contact because I'm ""not on the account""; this is despite the account holder looked you in the face and told you that I was going to be helping them so, ""Give him whatever he needs.""  If I could convince them to leave this bank, I would.
""We've had an increase of fraud activity...""  I'm starting to think it's not fraud, it's people having to circumvent your system in order to get anything done.

01/26/2023 18:49:52,Matthew Aagaard,"Firstly let me say that the entire staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, but I have never been more disappointed with a bank. First Citizen came highly recommended to me from a colleague. I opened an account on 12/22/22. I was told I‚Äôd have a debit card within 10 days to 2 weeks. It‚Äôs a little over a month now and not only do I still not have my debit card, they have no idea when it‚Äôs going to arrive. On 1/17/23, 26 days after ordering my original card, they canceled it and ordered a new one to be express shipped to me and I was told I should have it by that Friday 1/20/23. Here it is now 1/26/23 and they still don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs going to arrive. I understand supply chain slow downs and problems of short staffing but this is absolutely ridiculous. If you would like to be able to access your money in ways other than going down to the one branch and picking up cash I might suggest looking around a little more.",1,New Mexico,ChIJJbNWYUhQGIcROoVzQIq5sLc

Although FCB is business focused and the Banker, Mariah, who helped me specialized in business accounts her service was exceptional. She was able to find the information and explain all the accounts. I say that because I came into the ABQ branch on a Friday before a holiday weekend. Most of the staff was gone for holiday, but she was willing to open the account and not turn me away. She even found branches in the state where I was relocating and printed them for me so that I could have them handy upon arrival. Just recently she helped me when I fell prey to a debit card scam.  She answered my email quickly, froze/canceled the card and it was reissued the same day. I have felt well served and regarded even though I don't have a business account.

04/27/2017 18:51:58,Hannah B.,"First Citizens is an absolutely stellar financial institution to work with! After countless issues with another well-known local bank, my company decided to make the move to First Citizens. We were welcomed with open arms to say the least! The fees involved with certain transactions are significantly less than what we were paying with our old bank. We no longer have extreme hold times on deposits, and we can actually call the bank without going through a call center first!

The amount of amenities provided for its customers is absolutely outstanding! Fresh baked pastries in the lobby, large conference rooms available for client use, ability to call & speak directly with your banker, the list goes on. Our banker actually reviews our account every couple of months to make sure we continue to be in the right financial structure moving forward. She will even go out of her way to contact us when she has found additional benefits that we can utilize. I have never experienced a more personable bank, with individuals who genuinely care about the success and longevity of my business.

The building itself is stunning. Lots of art & antiques (dating as far back as the 1700s!) fill the hallways and offices. It is certainly unordinary to find such a gorgeous building here in Albuquerque. After the initial shock when walking in wears off, it is clear that First Citizens has made a true investment in the community and is here for good!",5,New Mexico,ChIJESbU6Dd0IocRT3zU5HWnyfs

I notice as others walk in or come to the drive-through, staff call them by their name and inquire on how they are doing as well.  They have been prompt with any questions or services I have needed.

But it is close to work and I thought it would be a close place to walk to (trying to get more exercise in these days and traffic is BAD around here with PDN construction).

When you walk into the lobby it is like you are walking through a cemetery mausoleum -- each step you take echos all over the place. I spoke and it echoed.  Just 2 workers in there was all I could see and no customers.  And all these empty offices/rooms around it.  It was just creepy.

I went ahead and asked for information about opening an account and the fees and such were outrageous! I'll just go down the street to the Wells Fargo or -- better yet -- see if I'm qualified for the credit union just a little further down the way -- may have to walk more to deposit a check during lunch hour, but not so creepy.

I guess they get a lot of business customers -- they sure aren't a bank for personal accounts unless you have lots of money deposited with them.",2,New Mexico,ChIJESbU6Dd0IocRT3zU5HWnyfs

They work with the most unprofessional towing company (the customer rep literally assaulted me while purposely giving me the run around until I pulled up government site to prove that I had enough proof to get my car). I think they get a cut back from the company because the bank wasn‚Äôt even open and they towed my car because I was closer to the bank than the other businesses? Would never use this bank and frankly they should reconsider the towing company they work with.

I noticed an interesting restaurant next to it called Kaedama that looked good and so I checked it out.  I walked back a couple minutes later to repark my car and someone had already put a boot on my car and demanded me to pay 168 dollars on the spot. A lady then jumped out of the bushes with a clip board and was more than eager to take my money.   This bank and its hired group of thugs they keep in the parking lot in my opinion complicit are extorting area customers at Miner Plaza II.

After my client made 2 trips to different PNC BANK branches and could not get it resolved, we tried First Citizens Bank's North Hill branch.  Tyler Cole at the branch greeted us friendly, carefully review the document, recognizing the challenge and then came up with a very smart solution. - He notarized my client's signature on the back of the page by printing out additional information necessary for the task to be done.

I'm the one who input it. They told me they didnt see a check pending and did not call someone to look into it further. They treated me like a waste of time and an  inconvenience to them. They are lazy and have no empathy at all for others. Sure enough, I called the customer service line and they found out what was going on in under 10 mins. I wouldnt have had to panic about missing money if this branch would have done what they were supposed to and would have listened to me.

01/10/2024 18:40:15,Ls Darrious,I stopped here at this bank on 1-8-24 to cash a $287 business check that was made out to me. I went through the drive thru and i gave the teller that was working the window my License and my account number. She was very rude to me from the start & She refused to cash my check because i had just had my drivers licenses renewed on 1-3-24 and the NC DMV gave me a paper copy of my drivers licenses until I received my hard copy through the mail. The teller claimed that she couldn‚Äôt cash my check because it wasnt a hard copy even after I explained my situation. The teller told me that she could deposit the check but she could not cash it. And then proceeded to tell me that I could pull over to the atm and get out the amount that i needed.‚Äù$100‚Äù  It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I didn‚Äôt get the teller name but i have a valid class A CDL license and anyone that has ever had to renew their license knows that the DMV issues a paper copy of your license. I have been with the bank for about 6 years. But i will be closing my account and going to another bank.,1,North Carolina,ChIJ1xZDpHWBq4kRqCpYUvs49eM

11/30/2023 16:55:08,H M,"After my mom's passing, I was forced to work with a financial representative from this branch. This representative made the process extremely challenging (took almost 2 months to complete). From the very beginning, they were standoffish and rude. I'm literally dealing with assets that I inherited because my mom, who I loved and sorely missed, died. No sympathy was given by this rep. Because this person worked hybrid (sometimes in the office and sometimes are home. Heaven forbid I call her on a Friday) several documents were 'lost' in the mailroom that apparently no one knew how to inspect because later several documents were found or they were 'never recieved'. Mind you that these documents had to be printed off, filled out, notarized, and mailed off. It was a process. Was I ever thanked for my patience or apologized to for the inconvenience? No. The last incident was perhaps the worst. Before mailing it off, I finally got wise and mailed it off with tracking. So I knew for sure the letter was received on 30 October (or there whereabouts). When the representative couldn't find it and the other people couldn't find it, she (the first rep) wanted me to mail it again. I refused. I said that I was tired of taking off working to notarize and mail off these letters. I had tracking and I knew they had them. She relented and said she'd look again. Surprise, surprise she found them. Again, no apologies whatsoever. When I asked her and another rep if I could speak to her supervisor I was blown off. My calls were never returned. I guess Representatives are allowed to mistreat customers especially when they're at their most vulnerable.",1,North Carolina,ChIJ02atbZFYrIkRiaA2SiZl8oo

However, this past week, Peyton has restored my faith in First Citizens by helping me on two separate occasions.  The first time I called to inquire about activity on my account that seemed fraudulent.  It was not, but Peyton was quick to research the issue and call me back within 30 minutes.  The second incident was particularly impressive; I paid my daughter's college tuition out of the incorrect account and Peyton called to allow me the opportunity to transfer the funds prior to being charged an overdraft fee.  I was completely shocked he remembered me,  had the fortitude to catch my error, and cared enough to call and let me know.  This branch is now my ""go-to"" location.

I was told I would receive a check for the balance of the accounts within 10 business days.  It is now 5/20/19 and I called to check the status for the second time since closing.  I was told I would have to wait 90 days to report the checks lost.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and Tanya told me the checks were mailed to the wrong address, but could not confirm it. She is going to call me back tomorrow after researching.  We also had a major issue getting FCB to change the acct our car loan was being debited from to the new bank in our current state.

I will update this review after resolution has been made, but for a customer who banked at FCB for the past 8 years I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them based on my experience over the last couple of months.

Update after a couple of weeks. It was verified checks were sent to the wrong place. I have to wait 90 days to ‚Äúreport them lost‚Äù so they can place a stop payment on them EVEN THOUGH they made this error.",1,North Carolina,ChIJ02atbZFYrIkRiaA2SiZl8oo

They told me they didn't have the money to give me from the check because apparently it was too much for them to give. The lady that said this did so with a smirk and a rude chuckle as if I was stupid for even trying. I then went to the first citizen in cary off of high house road and they cashed my check no questions asked. Same exact check, same bank, all within 20min. This first citizen location had horrible customer service. If I got the ladies name I would call her out in this review but I didn't. SO lucky her.",1,North Carolina,ChIJdX7YDiztrIkRxOz_F6IuXOg

We've been banking with them for about two years now, and I can confidently say they've played a significant role in our successful growth trajectory.

One thing we really appreciate is their digital banking platform. It's user-friendly, robust, and integrates smoothly with our accounting software, making financial management seamless. Whether it's making transfers, paying invoices, or receiving payments, everything is a breeze. They've nailed the user experience down to a tee, something you don't always see in the banking industry.

The customer service we've received is second to none. Every interaction with the bank, be it with their customer service representatives, relationship managers, or the business banking team, is a testament to their commitment to customer satisfaction. Issues (which are few and far between) are handled swiftly and effectively, often exceeding our expectations.",5,Oklahoma,ChIJi_OCSbMfsocRP2HR_42QMog

‚ÄúWe are a small local bank, sir. We don‚Äôt have a system that keeps track of it. The best we can do is have one ordered or you can come in Monday and get one.‚Äù

I understand if at that time they were understaffed or teller was overwhelmed with tasks at that moment, but what is being conveyed is that this bank is not adequately equipped to handle basic transactions and it also implies that mistakes could unknowingly occur with the transaction because the teller is not communicating. A small consolation is that this problem isn‚Äôt isolated to Citizens bank only, I‚Äôve noticed this from other banks as well, the only common thread is that this has happened with the younger tellers only.

11/20/2020 15:40:05,Judy Slater,"I always thought a bank is a bank is a bank and never expected to feel otherwise...until I started banking at Citizens Bank of Edmond a few years ago.  I started bragging to people that I had the coolest bank and they looked at me like I was crazy.  Because like me they thought all banks were the same.  Pre-Covid they had a free community coffee shop, fancy coffees for clients and local goodies.  They even gave out Christmas presents each year in the lobby.  The staff was always helpful and friendly.  Then Covid hit, and I‚Äôve got to say, I feel like none of my social groups supported me like my bank did.  They made me aware of small business government programs I might qualify for and helped me apply and submit my application.  One day I was in the bank and asked Luke what he thought about one grant program and he told me the deadline was in 3 hours!  He gave me a list of info to collect and said if I brought it to him he would make it happen.   He dropped everything, got my application in and I got the grant.  If you are like I once was and think all banks are the same, you haven‚Äôt been to Citizens Bank of Edmond.",5,Oklahoma,ChIJi_OCSbMfsocRP2HR_42QMog

I called last week to make an appointment regarding a new account. My mother recently died of Covid-19 and as the Executor I need to establish a checking account to settle her estate.  Ismail Beraza was supposed to call me today at 10 am to go over the specifics, but he didn't call. I tried calling several times and after a half-hour got to talk with him. I explained the situation, including the part where he didn't call me as scheduled. No apology, no condolences. Ismail listed the documents I needed to send him by secure communication. I sent the required documents and will write another review after everything is done. I hope it's more positive than this one. This bank has changed over the years.

Then they charged me $6 a day for 2 months straight and closed the account out. I've tried to work with them and pay the overdraft fee or any part I'm responsible for, they offered to knock off $100, that was it. They want me to pay close to $500 in fees.This bank will screw you over in a heartbeat. Charging $6 a day for 60 days is absolute robbery but they get away with it because there's nothing you can do about it.  It took 1.5 months of calling and never getting returned calls and then me finally driving 1.5hrs from home to the bank to get told we can only knock off $100. Absolutely rediculous, I will more happy take care of my responsibilities but I'm not going to be robbed.

I have been with this bank over a year and even have an SBA loan with them. I have never had a worse experience with a bank in my life. I am currently in the process of moving all my accounts to another bank. All of the people at their corporate location, their SBA department, as well as the some of the higher level managers at the local branches are wholly incompetent.

11/01/2023 23:46:05,"Christine E. Sexton, BBA, MSS","I tried to get help with a recurring issue that I am having with a mortgage loan that this company purchased. Because I don't have any accounts at the Abilene location (even though I live in Abilene and bought the house IN ABILENE), I was told that nothing could be done and that I could not be helped. I am now on hold with the 1-877 number and have been for 40+ minutes. The last time I called, I was on hold for over 2 hours, and apparently, the problem wasn't fixed then, either. This is the 4th time I've called for this issue. It's ridiculous, and it's even more ridiculous that this local branch cannot handle this issue for me. I may work at First Financial Bank and be a bit biased, but this would NEVER HAPPEN THERE! First of all, you would never sit on hold that long. Our goal is to pick up by the 3rd ring.
Even if you get the wrong department, the person who answers the phone will figure out what you need, find the person who can best help you (even if they are at a different branch or the corporate office), put you on a brief hold to call that person and give them a rundown of what's wrong so you don't have to repeat yourself, conference you in to introduce you, and then pass you to the person who can help you. If they can't immediately help you, they take your number down, do the research needed to answer your question, and call you back, typically within an hour or two but no later than 24 hours. I have also worked in the Air Force Finance Office as its commander, and I would NEVER have allowed my staff to treat any of our customers this way. I am beyond disappointed by your company's customer service, and I've only been using you since January. I do not look forward to the next 30 years, and if this indicates how they will be, I may choose to shop around for a refinance in the future.",1,Oregon,ChIJ8Q-x7paNVoYR-kAtF3ubOfU

If a bank doesn‚Äôt acknowledge deposits until the next business day, it‚Äôs common sense that they shouldn‚Äôt allow electronic debits After hours either.

So at night your balance can fall below zero. You can send an electronic deposit to cover it that night but when the tellers come in the morning, they will post the debit before the credit and charge you an overdraft fee anyway.

ANY bank can redeem them for me. They said they couldnt, and only would do it for customers. Well I walked across the street to FIRST CITIZENS BANK. No issues, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They didnt even mention me having an account. I actually had to ask. They didnt hold my business hostage in order to help me. The only reason I didnt open an account with them on the spot is because I didnt have my social security card. Im going back next week. When you take the time to drive to a place and they dissappoint you, ya cant help but get a ONE STAR. After I redeemed my bonds I walked back to them and asked them why they couldnt do it.

04/07/2024 15:06:19,Melissa Hicks,"A piece of mail from this bank came in a few days ago, which triggered a memory of one of the most humiliating, degrading experiences. Now I would like to share that experience.

Between Dec 2021 and Feb 2022, I applied for a home refinance loan. When I finished the phone call with David, I was left feeling inferior and feeling like I am a deadbeat. This man was so harsh, he actually made me cry.

At the time, I was divorced and wanted to refinance to get my ex-husband‚Äôs name off the mortgage loan so he could buy something else. I thought at the same time, I could roll up a few other payments I had into that loan. I ended up getting the loan somewhere else because the loan officer at this bank stereotyped me and maybe even discriminated against me.

He stereotyped me because I have student debt. None of the debt was unpaid or past due but he made an assumption that I would never pay the debt. I had a mix of private and government student loans. I was paying on the private loans. The payment on the government loans were on hold because of Covid. Everyone‚Äôs were. He told me when they went off hold, he didn‚Äôt think I would pay them. Having no delinquent items ever at all on my credit report, I would love to know how he came to that conclusion. Furthermore, why would I even bother to pay the private loans if I were a problematic borrower with the intention of defaulting.

During the call, he made the comment to me that I would never be able to maintain the property. Maybe he thought because I‚Äôm a woman I‚Äôm too dumb to use tools or lack the physical strength to operate a mower. Perhaps I would be too ignorant to know if my sink is leaking. I‚Äôm not sure what he meant. I took offense to it because I think the comment was uncalled for.

I was asking for $45,000 for a property that appraised for $85,000. Most new cars cost more than $45,000. The way this man acted, you would think I asked to borrow $450K.

Regarding the stereotyping, I realize that a lot of student loan borrowers never repay. If none of us repaid, there would be no private lenders and the program for government loans would no longer exist. The ones who do not pay are louder- they are the ones you see in the news demanding their debts be forgiven. I‚Äôm pretty sure he stereotyped me with all of those people. Just assumed I‚Äôd be like them and never pay.

Following that call, I began working with DollarBank. I got a conventional loan with them on less than a 3% interest. The whole loan process with DB was easier than this one phone call with this man. The fact DB financed the loan leads me to wonder if I was declined based on my credit or based on this man‚Äôs opinions.

I am a hard working, driven, motivated woman. No one has the right to make me feel inferior, especially over a little $45,000 loan.

I went to school to train so I could better myself and not have to work for peanuts my entire life. Now that I have a more substantial salary and own a business, I have no interest in this bank whatsoever. My husband banks with them. That‚Äôs his choice. I never will, all because of one man on a power trip.",1,Tennessee,ChIJWSQX-ft_WogRXCNzRNjoQa4
05/08/2023 12:54:20,Lisa Morrow,"My husband and I have dear friends that work at this bank, so I thought I would open a savings account. I was told it was a good idea to have funds in more than one location. I entered the branch on Broad St. and proceeded to the teller. There was only one customer ahead of me and there were three tellers. I patiently waited for my turn or at least to have one of them make eye contact and ask me if I needed assistance. I waited over 6 minutes (there was a large clock above the teller area)....they NEVER acknowledged my existence or asked me to come forward. They still had the signs that stated to keep 6 ft. distance. I had a substantial amount with me to deposit but I left!

We've referred multiple friends and business associates to Citizens as well due to the great service. Term sheets have been very quick and its been a great relationship for us as we grow our real estate business. Any issues have been quickly fixed when I stop by and all the employees know who we are which is a large benefit of a community bank.,5,Tennessee,ChIJryJ7RjQjXIgR3IfRuwdYdeY

07/29/2022 15:45:01,Kenny Phillips,"I had cds with bank since it was opened with Mr Wheeler. In Dec 2021 a cd matured and clerk called me ask what I wanted to do.
I agreed to leave if I could withdraw anytime without a penalty. I was told that would be fine. Rates changed so I requested to withdraw with the manager she said I would have to pay plenty for early withdrawal. I explained what I was told and it was confirmed with the clerk. Manager said clerk or her cannot make a decision over $ 1000.00. So she checked and said I would have to pay 1200.00 penalty on 600.00 of interest.
So I paid the penalty. The lesson is don‚Äôt bank with a company that will not stand behind what the clerk says and a manager that cannot make a 1000.00 decision should not be running a bank.",1,Tennessee,ChIJryJ7RjQjXIgR3IfRuwdYdeY

11/01/2023 23:46:05,"Christine E. Sexton, BBA, MSS","I tried to get help with a recurring issue that I am having with a mortgage loan that this company purchased. Because I don't have any accounts at the Abilene location (even though I live in Abilene and bought the house IN ABILENE), I was told that nothing could be done and that I could not be helped. I am now on hold with the 1-877 number and have been for 40+ minutes. The last time I called, I was on hold for over 2 hours, and apparently, the problem wasn't fixed then, either. This is the 4th time I've called for this issue. It's ridiculous, and it's even more ridiculous that this local branch cannot handle this issue for me. I may work at First Financial Bank and be a bit biased, but this would NEVER HAPPEN THERE! First of all, you would never sit on hold that long. Our goal is to pick up by the 3rd ring.
Even if you get the wrong department, the person who answers the phone will figure out what you need, find the person who can best help you (even if they are at a different branch or the corporate office), put you on a brief hold to call that person and give them a rundown of what's wrong so you don't have to repeat yourself, conference you in to introduce you, and then pass you to the person who can help you. If they can't immediately help you, they take your number down, do the research needed to answer your question, and call you back, typically within an hour or two but no later than 24 hours. I have also worked in the Air Force Finance Office as its commander, and I would NEVER have allowed my staff to treat any of our customers this way. I am beyond disappointed by your company's customer service, and I've only been using you since January. I do not look forward to the next 30 years, and if this indicates how they will be, I may choose to shop around for a refinance in the future.",1,Texas,ChIJ8Q-x7paNVoYR-kAtF3ubOfU

09/29/2023 02:32:26,Cynthia Willcox,Three years ago during the Covid pandemic my father passed away from congestive heart failure. My father had a savings account which I could not get due to the fact that my dad did not leave a will. In order to get the funds I would have to provide a letter of testamentary proving I was his daughter. At the time my dad had a checking account with the same amount of money as the amount in the savings account here. I had no problem getting the funds from chase bank.  I had to fill out a heir affidavit and provide  another piece of documentation but I got what was rightfully mine in full. The vice president made me feel like I was a criminal and lying about being his only daughter and his only kid. Anyways even almost three years after my father's death I think this bank needs to teach their employees some compassion and not require court paperwork in order to get what is theirs.,1,Texas,ChIJO_wvqcowR4YR2xC1rDp9OfM

I have no complaints about the staff as they are very friendly, but I do agree with the poster above. Their systems are antiquated and don't apply common sense to banking. I put money into a ""free checking"" account and simply continued to make deposits. I didn't have activity on the account for a couple of months so I got charged an ""inactive fee"".  I have never heard of a fee for not using my own money, but there is truly no such thing as free. When my online access was cut off and my information purged from the system because they weren't sure if I was ""still around"", I called to close the account. Guess what? They didn't even ask why. If they are not interested in keeping access to the funds of a good account who never touches his money, what are they interested in? I'll give you a clue...it's not banking.",1,Virginia,ChIJHR65pXIhsokR0zWkVd7-WWQ

However, CB&T's technology is 10 to 20 years behind every other bank.  For example, if you have a loan with CB&T and want to make your monthly payment online using a different bank's checking account (a Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or whatever checking account), their systems cannot process the payment - not over the phone talking to a person, not on the 24-hour system, not online.  That becomes very frustrating being forced to mail in a payment every month - they quickly stand out as outdated.",3,Virginia,ChIJHR65pXIhsokR0zWkVd7-WWQ

This bank wasn‚Äôt patient enough to wait for the full payment of my loan , for the gap to pay for it. I talked to them about it that I‚Äôm waiting for my gap claims to be released. The lady in charged of the car loan went , it is my responsibility to pay it off and just wait for the release of my claims because it will affect my credit scores. I went I don‚Äôt care of my credit scores, the car isn‚Äôt under my care anymore . I told her I‚Äôm waiting for my gap insurance to be released. And after that conversation my credit score was down for -77. I advised that don‚Äôt get loan from this bank. It sucks, they will ruin your credit scores when they don‚Äôt get their money right away. I didn‚Äôt have that kind of treatment from Wells Fargo and Santander even I informed them about the situation. They gave me grace period to wait for the Gap claims due that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that my gap claims check wasn‚Äôt  release right away to pay the loan in full.

08/13/2013 14:14:25,Tim Stone,"Horrible customer service!  We moved and were looking for a new bank. As luck had it our company got a check issued from one of their account holders. Drove over to check it out and see about switching over. They wanted $5 to cash the check and refused to waive the fee.

Despite waiting to speak to the manger ""Pam"" for 15 minutes while she chatted on a personal call and asking why they wouldn't waive a fee for a check issued from their bank. Pams answer "" I'm not a banker"" Then why does it say manager on her   door at a bank and why did the clerk tell me to wait to talk to her about the fee?

When I asked why My bank doesnt charge them to cash the check Pam said
""Because we are not a credit union.""

Got my answer about switching over. Clearly stay with the credit union. More of a drive but better service.

If they are this rude and unprofessional with prospective customers I can only imagine how they are with their actual clients.  On the plus side there was no wait in line at this place. I'm guessing that's because no one wants to bank with them due to them looking to pay their bills by hitting anyone they can up for ""Convenience Fees"".

Pick a different bank and get better service. Any bank since it doesn't get much worse at Citizens bank of Mukwonago.",1,Wisconsin,ChIJtcD45NelBYgRbcZ6-Sg7kSc

01/03/2020 22:21:45,Mike Zoril,"I had all my deposit accounts as well as a mortgage with this bank.  This was simple because I could use online banking to transfer funds from my deposit accounts to my mortgage account online.  However, later the bank closed all my deposit accounts making it difficult to pay my mortgage.  I attempted to pay the mortgage in person, with cash.  The bank manager at the Waukesha branch refused to accept the payment without an ID and stated it was bank policy to not conduct any transaction over $1 without an ID.  I have previously worked for CBM and this was never the policy when I was employed by this bank.  The branch manager also verbally admitted that this was not a policy that I agreed to when taking out a mortgage on my house, but yet still refused to accept my mortgage payment in cash without an ID.  My attorney stated what the bank is doing is an illegal violation of my rights because cash is legal tender for all debts public and private.  If there is no agreement to show ID, then there is no requirement to show it.  These people are incompetent.  Pull all your money out of this bank.",1,Wisconsin,ChIJtcD45NelBYgRbcZ6-Sg7kSc

10/26/2023 16:16:02,Tristian Nelson,"Bank manager was completely useless. Tried to pass on the state medical examiners number so they can get in contact with the bank to confirm a death in the family. Dude didn't care about helping me, he didn't care about pointing me in the right direction. Dude may have been there for 23 years but I'm willing to bet his customer satisfaction scores are terrible. I also work in banking, and idk if the company I worked for just cared that much for their customers but we would push people as far up the ladder to corporate as we possibly could to help resolve a customers situation or complaint. This guy or this bank needs to refocus a little bit. Learn to talk to customers.",1,Wisconsin,ChIJjaXQwBb_BIgRH8EczHiQ0Bw
