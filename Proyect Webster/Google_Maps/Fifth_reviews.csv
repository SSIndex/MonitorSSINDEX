03/26/2024 14:23:04,Mike Meeker,Do not put your money in this bank. They will come up with every excuse in the book not to give it to you when you want it. We have been trying to get cash from them for over a week and they keep giving us excuse after excuse as to why they cannot give it to us. I’m pretty sure what they’re doing is illegal.,1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
12/06/2023 17:42:04,Jason Mccord,"I had funds removed from my account on 11/24/23 by WalMart.com.I've been given the run around by this institution on multiple  calls.I contacted the branch in Springhill Tn because the customer support call center isn't giving info or updates on Dispute/fraud of missing funds.I was penalized 8days for this.Noone at the local location or dispute/fraud will help in this matter.I'm very disappointed in the negative run around and lack of information on my case.They just take and release funds from account without a transaction code or ref#.I want to close this account but, now have to wait 90 days.Customer service is impossible to communicate with.Managers and supervisors are never available. Told today by fraud dept they were too busy to speak with me.5/3 lost me as a customer today.",1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU

07/30/2021 16:27:27,Emily Todd,"I’ve been using fifth third for about 3 years now and they are always so pleasant. Everytime I walk in i’m always warmly greeted, they make sure to go as fast as possible to ensure that you are not waiting around for the things you need to be done. I have personally talked to Josh, the manager there as well as one of their bankers, Madison. They both have been nothing but kind to me and have helped me out tremendously. When I was looking to buy a new car, they helped me figure out the best course of action and helped me figure out a budget plan. I would genuinely recommend Fifth Third to anyone who asked, you will not be disappointed by their willingness to help. Thank you to the Fifth Third team and more specifically Josh for being an awesome manager, leader and team player. Thank you to Madison as well for being incredibly nice and always making me feel welcomed!",5,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
07/30/2021 19:54:04,Chad Overstreet,"The Spring Hill team is FANTASTIC! I’ve dealt with them weekly for 4 years now and the service alone will keep me from switching banks. They treat you like family and always make sure everything is taken care of. Keep up the great work!

07/09/2020 18:49:51,Jessica Fort,"My married name is actually Fort just in case someone from 5/3 actually reads this. Two months ago we received an offer on our house, the buyer chose to use 5/3 mortgage to purchase our home...this has by far been the most frustrating situation we have ever had to deal with. We have been given a closing date going on 3 times and have been ensured for 3 weeks that the paperwork has been received...it’s all a lie...we keep getting the “hopefully tomorrow bs” this isn’t even our hold up it is the buyer who I am sure is equally frustrated. We will never bank with or sell a house to someone who uses 5/3 mortgage ever again. I do not recommend their services to anyone.",1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU

07/30/2021 18:02:29,Laura Shindon,I would not recommend Fifth Third Bank Spring Hill. Our experience was not good when we moved to the Spring Hill area. I wasn't sure if this was just a Tennessee thing but after speaking with other banks in the area we found much better options. We went to a local bank and didn't feel like we were being manipulated and lied too. I think there are far better and more trustworthy banks out there.,1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
07/30/2021 19:57:56,Liv D,Spring Hill Fifth Third is truly an awesome and trustworthy bank. They are quick and dependable yet friendly and I always leave smiling. The all staff are knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions!,5,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
11/14/2018 19:18:00,D Hillebrand,"This is long, but needs to be explained.  I have been with this bank for over 5 years.  I used my debit card on October 30, 2018 to pay off a large debt of a little over $5100.00.  I received a ""fraud alert"" text because of the large amount.  I responded to the text, making it clear that I had indeed made the transaction.  I received an acknowledgement back via text indicating that the transaction was approved and that I could continue using my card as normal.

I was out of town for over a week. Upon arriving back home yesterday, I attempted to use my debit card. to buy groceries. It was declined.  Highly embarrassed, I called the 1-800 number on the back of my card.  Long story short, after almost two hours, three further calls, three dropped calls during transfers on their end, long conversations with both 5/3 reps AND World Pay reps (5/3 Bank outsources their fraud services),  I was told that my debit card was had been canceled on October 31 due to fraud!!!  And, NO ONE had a clue as to WHY.  In the end, I was told that I must speak to someone at my local branch for assistance.

I contacted my local branch first thing this morning...then called the branch again two hours later when my phone messages and email  went without response.  I demanded to stay on the phone until Michael Logue could speak with me.  Michael looked into the matter, and informed me that the debit card had indeed been cancelled October 31st due to ""fraudulent activity.""  (Duh...I knew that much already!)  He said that there was no ""documented"" reason for the cancellation.  His only explanation was that Fifth Third debit cards have a $5000 limit...never mind how much you have in the bank.  Never mind that you have a PIN.  Never mind that you verify at the time of the transaction that you are the actual owner of the account, that it is YOUR money, and that you approve the debit.  He could not explain to me why I was never notified in any manner (not a further text, not an email, not a phone call, not even freaking snail mail).  He could not explain to me why a replacement card was never ordered.

So, for two weeks I didn't know my debit card was cancelled.  For two weeks, several automatic payments I had set up to pay via debit card were being rejected (payments to auto-fill prescriptions,  payments to my physician, subscription services, that do not accept other payment methods, etc.).

Now, after two days of pursuing answers and many stressful hours of frustration, dropped calls, rude people, incompetency,  and bungling by the bank, all I know as fact is:
1. Fifth/Third cancelled my debit card,
2. No one at the 1-800 national level OR at my local Spring Hill, TN branch can definitively tell me who canceled it or why,
3.  No one at the 1-800 national level OR at my local Spring Hill, TN branch has a CLUE as to why I wasn't notified in some manner,
4. Apparently no one on Earth has a clue why I wasn't at least sent a new card to replace the one they canceled and
5. It will take, according to Michael Logue, 5-7 business days to get a freaking replacement card!!!  Well isn't THAT special?  They can deny me access to my own money with the snap of a finger and not be able to explain why everything ""fell through the cracks"" (as Michael so eloquently put it) yet they can't expedite me a new card???

Meanwhile, their cluster-&#$@ has cost me over $700 that I know of thus far, including the additional interest charged on the initial transaction that I had APPROVED and that I thought was paid.  I'll be spending the rest of the day calling my creditors trying to humbly explain that the bank thoroughly screwed me.  I'll have to pay them all with a CREDIT CARD, since I don't have any access to my own money except by check...and NO ONE takes checks!!!

Not that it matters, but I am widowed, on disability, 63 years old, and have to manage my money VERY tightly.  This ordeal will likely deplete my emergency fund. This isn't the first raw deal I have gotten from 5/3 Bank, but it will definitely be my LAST.",1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
05/03/2021 14:54:08,Rob Hutchison,Fifth third bank Spring Hill Tn has the most incompetent mortgage dept. If your thinking about obtaining a loan from this particular bank I would advise you to go elsewhere. The mortgage lender spends more time telling you about his political views than he does doing his job. The sad part is that his boss is aware that he acts in an inappropriate manner and does nothing about it.,1,Alabama,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
12/13/2017 15:34:08,Charles Summers,Michel Logue is why this isn't a 5* review. He treated me very poorly. Even attempted get smart with me. His customer relations is very rude.

Carlos was particularly unhelpful - as he initially made the claim that SFCU was the institution to blame. He then went on to claim that the fees were being processed as ""card replacement fees"" which was also false, as I have used the same debit card for years.

02/12/2024 19:33:57,Braden Perkins,"Smooth Home Loan Experience with Fifth Third Bank in Delaware!

My experience securing a home loan with Fifth Third Bank in Delaware, Ohio, has been nothing short of exceptional.

The loan application process was smooth and efficient, thanks to the knowledgeable and helpful staff. They guided me through each step, providing clarity on the documentation required and patiently answering all my questions.

The personalized service extended beyond the application phase. The team at Fifth Third Bank was proactive in keeping me updated on the loan progress, ensuring a transparent and stress-free experience.

The competitive rates offered by Fifth Third Bank added to the overall appeal of choosing them as my home loan provider. The terms and conditions were clearly explained, and there were no hidden surprises along the way.

The ATM service at the Delaware branch has also been convenient, providing easy access to my funds and account information.

Fifth Third Bank in Delaware has exceeded my expectations in facilitating a seamless home loan process. Their professionalism, transparency, and competitive rates make them a top choice for anyone considering a home loan. Five stars well-deserved!",5,Delaware,ChIJoT9Gi8X6OIgRqqa99jG--bA
03/07/2024 23:46:23,Caleb Pearson,I've gotten nothing but grief from Fifth Third since opening a new account. Their customer service is lackluster at best and they don't really seem to care about you after they've secured your money. Customer service simply sends you to their call center where they essentially just tell you to go to the physical location (most likely because thier call centers run on a time quota rather than amount of issues resolved). The problem being that the employees at the physical location are unable to assist with what I need done. Terrible first impression on a new customer and I will most likely be searching for a different financial institution moving forward.,1,Delaware,ChIJoT9Gi8X6OIgRqqa99jG--bA

We both have had a personal account with 5/3 since 2016. We went in last week to open a Business account. The first thing Donna did was look at her watch then said “I only have 40 minutes so I’m not sure we’ll be able to get this done before I leave.” She lied and said I needed my marriage license since the name on the business was my new last name, and the name on my license was my old last name, however since I already have a personal account with my new last name the marriage license wasn’t necessary. (We confirmed with a Branch Manager at different location) She also left the room and acted like she went to ask a co-worker if we needed the marriage license, but she didn’t ask him. She just didn’t want to help us. Thankfully we went to the branch on S.Combee rd and we were able to get the Business account up and running.

07/25/2019 14:59:34,Dalton Broadus,"I went to this branch in July of 2017, to pay off the debit and credit card balance that I owed, and close my debit card. I was helped by a black clerk (don't remember her name now) and paid everything off. Everything went fine until my credit starts suffering because Chase claims that I did not pay $32 in an outstanding balance. As a result, by credit suffered and it was hard to get approved for a new card. The only explanation is that the lady I dealt with S!T!O!L!E! my money and did not process it.

I've been trying to dispute this for two years now. Do not bank with 5th 3rd if you do not want your money stolen. Research all the times this company has been in trouble with the government.",1,Florida,ChIJq-xFuE053YgRjHXQDIvacAs

The brief encounter I had with Donna Pinix 'the supposed lead teller', is by far the worst. Zero customer service skills! No conversational skills. Just here to collect my check is the vibe she gave off the entire time. I was in there to get a new 360 card and she didn't bother to tell me any details about the card, like the fact that you have to wait 24 hours to use it and I needed money ASAP. I found this out on my own attempting to use the card AFTER I left. When I came back she like ""Ohhh you have to wait 24 hours""  with a look of annoyance. No apology for the inconvenience, nothing. I go to the front counter to get money out and she proceeds to make a phone call about ordering some ribs. Like, are you serious?! Please higher ups, give Donna Pinix customer skills training.",1,Florida,ChIJq-xFuE053YgRjHXQDIvacAs

02/20/2020 19:49:42,Jason Owner&Operator,Don't bank here. I went in here to cash a check from one of my customers and i tell you what this is why i charge my customers an aggervation charge for coming here. Yes i do. They wanted me to open an account which is free but here is the kicker. If i have an account here and so does my customer you can't cash the check that day. Takes 1 to 3 days for it to clear even though all parties bank here. I rather pay the $7 fee to avoid this. Then they tried the old fake credit/debit card push on me. What this is that u give them $300 which u can't touch or theirs fines for it. It's like a Visa reloadable card which you can get at Walmart but with their rules on it. The old it will build your credit BS. Then finally they opened a checking account for me using my information which i did not authorize. Got a debit card in the mail which i cancelled right away. Called corporate and filed at Bartow courthouse yesterday for investigation. Really they did this i never signed anything i dont want the account because of the check hold process here. They thought i would just go with it by it coming in the mail. My company no longer takes check for anyone banking here and i state why even if they don't ask. Fraud flag flying here.,1,Florida,ChIJq-xFuE053YgRjHXQDIvacAs

12/21/2023 18:27:54,Jessica Kostman,I am giving this location a one star rating because of Felicia. She was extremely rude when I came in to open a new account. She seemed like she did not want to help from the start. I handed her my ID and told her my address has changed because we had just moved here. She immediately caught an attitude and told me she needed proof of address or to go get my ID updated she tried to end it there but I asked for other options. I understand protocols and I wouldn't mind coming back with the correct documentation but it's how she handled the situation. When I told her what I do have with my address she said those things just won't work. She was annoyed looking up another option. Once she told me the other options she sat my ID on the counter and ignored me as she started to talk to someone else. Idk why people like her are employed in positions where customer service is key. She could care less if I were to come back but she should care because the less people who come to this bank put her and others employed with this bank jobs at risk because soon no one will want to bank here. I have never had this kind of service at any other bank.,1,Florida,ChIJ52Pw0CeP54gRW_19PPPbPUA

I’ve been banking with them since I was three years old, and I will say that the staff here are extremely rude AND IGNORANT. I was not greeted upon entering, the staff member was rolling her eyes, and speaking to another staff member about getting off early “ she said she was ready to go”— which is probably why she had a nasty attitude. I also asked her about my access card and she said you should have gotten the notifications in the mail. When I told her I did not then she abruptly said: “ well, you should have, and they will mail you a check’”.

She was also very dismissive and did not ask me if I needed other services, which I did, but I felt like I wasn’t getting the services I needed so I just left.

Requesting documents multiple times and claiming they were not received, changing qualifications near the end of the process, to include requiring opening a new account and automating the monthly payment. Multiple times I reached out to my reps over the last 6 months for updates and no one would respond timely to my calls or emails (always took 2 or more weeks for them to respond and in many cases they never responded).

The was only 1 person opening accounts. We waited about 30 minutes. No one called for us. We waited some more. Apparently making an appointment makes no difference at this bank. It's not like Chase where if you make an appointment...you have an appointment. After half an hour, a banker, named ""Michael"", came by and just called someone. He  never asked if we had an appointment and I had to blurt out that we had an appointment. He acted annoyed and just cut me off and acted like we were interrupting him. Shouldn't the people at the bank be checking if anyone has an appointment? What's the point of making an appointment if you still end up waiting at the back of the line with everyone else? After a whole hour after we were scheduled to have our appointment, the banker Michael got up and walked to a teller. While he was there I went over to speak with him. He was speaking to the teller, so I waited. When he was done speaking to the teller, he saw me standing there waiting and walked away trying to avoid me. Pathetic.

09/29/2023 12:46:32,B J,"This bank is the worst bank I've ever had to do business with.  They unfortunately purchased my mortgage from another lender.  I had an insurance claim that I've been working for a year to resolve so I can fix my house.  Fifth Third has been absent from the entire process leaving me to figure it out on my own.  Then once I pay lawyers, adjusters, contractors, and get a settlement.  Then they decide to step in and at first tell me to just head to the bank and they can endorse it and I would be on my way.  No that employee was lying. Because of that inaccuracy I had the first check expire and a month later am still working on getting it reissued.  They force you to mail the check to them.  Then they open an escrow account and I am told I have to submit proposals to them to get any part of the funds I need.  I had to pay $60 to mail them the check and they wouldn't disclose any of this until they already had my check.  This is not how you do business. Just be transparent.  Additionally every person I have spoken with will tell me a different procedure or provide information completely conflicting with the person prior to them.  So if you want to give control over your decision making and the ability to fix your property in a timely manor, sure finance your house with this bank. At this point I am living in a house with black mold prolonged by Fifth Thirds distrust in its own customers who they should be doing everything they can to support.",1,Florida,ChIJhTbTHx3i2IgRNz4qZ6EvRDg

So after going to different branches and experiencing the exact same thing. I called CS service and she was very condescending towards me. A rep from the Sand Lake branch called me to see if I was satisfied. And convinced me to stay, was supposed to get a call back about another service I needed, still waiting for that call back over a year later. Today I had it with this branch, one drive thru and the customer in front of me was taking her sweet time. I could hear the teller laughing and they deep in a conversation.

08/15/2022 14:32:21,Shawn Johnson,"Worst experience I've ever had with ANY establishment. In regards to banking, I've not had any situations that even remotely compare to the level of condescending, provocative, inappropriate, dismissive behavior I was the target of moments ago by Al the branch manager of this location. My apartment doesn't allow split payments - so my roommate transferred his half to to me and for whatever the reason, the money was taken from my account instead. He contacted Fifth Third and they did nothing and said the money was NOT deducted from my Fairwinds account - which it clearly was; my account went negative after the $1100 was taken. Fifth Third did not work to resolve the issue, so I filed a dispute on my end with Fairwinds. They recovered the money and credited me the overdraft fees that were caused. Then, Fifth Third closed my roommates account and said the I caused fraudulent activity when reality is  I had absolutely nothing to do with the unauthorized withdrawal from my account. My roommate set up a conference call and I attempted to explain what things transpired on my account - he immediately cut me off and asked me an irrelevant rhetorical question, then continued to speak to my roommate and disregarded the fact that the whole point of the call was for me to explain what happened with my account - including insulting me and my intelligence in an extremely condescending tone with an up north accent - very detestable representation of a banking institution. It seems its a common theme at this bank - the fraud department there was the same caliber of ignorance. Al offered no solution except that my roommates account will be closed in 30 days and cant access his money for 30 days pending the dispute results - which my bank has already confirmed that it was complete days ago - therefore the funds in my roommates account should be released. To begin with, his account should have never been closed. Very suspicious situation from the beginning - shady people, shady establishment. It's a shame that there is no integrity within at least several employees at this bank. An employee at Fairwinds use to work for Fifth Third and said he had to leave due to the level of issues that went on there. If your hard earned money is important to you, stay away from this bank. Getting in touch with corporate is my next step since no one locally wants to collect a paycheck in light of not assisting hard working people. We're all adults and should understand times are stressful for many of us right now - this is the last thing anyone needs to add to their plate - ignorant, provocative people who are suppose to have a job to do and in a professional helpful manner.",1,Florida,ChIJlY2-PzN854gR_GyRw5dz740

I am physically disabled and have trouble with memory loss and cognitive thoughts.
Had a meeting in November where a lot was discussed, so with my poor memory emailed a couple of days later, asking Fifth Third to advise whether my email was correct or not, and to advise if I had misunderstood anything. Obviously no response.
One of the points agreed in the meeting was a fee free account going forward. In May I was charged a $25 monthly fee! I disputed this; the amount being refunded but another $25 fee charged in June. I requested this be refunded to be advised you can only get one refund per 12 month period! You can't make it up! It's Fifth Third's fault that the fee has been charged but they won't refund it!
I then called an employee at the branch (for some reason they can't call you) who agreed to put me the Momentum checking account which is fee free. I asked him to confirm what we discussed in an email, which he promised to do. Obviously he didn't so I emailed again, outlining the points discussed asking him to advise if my understanding is correct or not. He never responded and two $3.95  fees have now been charged!

07/07/2020 15:28:37,Amber Wood,"The worst bank I have ever encountered! Please take your business elsewhere I can't tell enough people.  I opened an account with them about a year ago just so I could have access to a bank close to where I live. I had moved from out of state and planned to still continue to bank with my out of state bank but wanted a place close to where a lived. When I set the appointment the gentleman who set up the account seemed very nice in person we discussed how I just wanted the basic checking account to have access to deposit and withdraw money and any paper checks I may receive. It was all fine at that point. The very next week I start getting calls and voicemails from their corporate fraud department all day while i was trying to work and I finally got ahold is them and turns out the ""nice"" man at the bank had opened several other accounts under my name to get credit and thier wasn't any money in them (I didn't want them or know about them) and their own corporate team was trying to have me help get this guy for fraud.  They kept telling me the only way to resolve it was to go and sit with the bank manager and request a meeting.  Honestly I never did because thats not my job as a customer to help catch employees committing fraud. I decided to just keep the account with little money in it enough to keep it open instead of dealing with thier drama and continue banking with a good bank. Flash forward to today I needed to cash a check and they were the only bank close so swing into drive thru and they said it will be $5.50 to cash a check and I thought there was some confusion so I let them know I held an account there just in case that was for non account holders. The girl was rude and said that's always the charge for check cashing. I was never told that and scoured my information and public information and couldn't find anything.  When I was given the receipt it simply says ""miscellaneous fees"". Seriously don't know how this sketchy bank stays in business.  Stay away!",1,Florida,ChIJCwK2wIp83YgRCo_rt7XVit8

The manager is useless with the rest of the people that work at this location. Took my business a few miles away to Bank of America and was treated good and they went above and beyond when I opened my account. I received a temp debit card and within 4 business days had my permanent debit card.,1,Florida,ChIJCwK2wIp83YgRCo_rt7XVit8
12/11/2017 21:22:03,Matthew Greenberg,"This Branch have worse customer service I ever seen. Manager is talking to his co workers and laughing while people are waiting in line. .I recently got hit with multiple overdrawn fees because they put extensive hold on my check that I deposited on November 30th. They cleared it on December 10th so I was left without money to pay for my bills like rent, leases and other payments that needs to be paid by 1st.  I talked to Manager Daniel and asked him to reverse those fees at least some of them especially that I received a letter from 5/3 Bank that those fees will be reversed if that big check will clear during Hold time - He gave me response - You got hit really bad. But nothing I can do for you. He is total ignorant. I have no idea why this Bank keeps him there as a Manager - I wouldn't want him even as an employee. When I was adding second account for my business - he was telling me stories that I don't want to hear about his Grand Father  and thought that it was entertaining to me. What a lack of respect of customers time. I was watching that guy for a while and his lack of respect to all people. He always calls me Michael even though my name is Matthew and he knows that because he can see on my account. Very disrespectful guy . Today when he told me that he will not do anything to reverse those fees - I was fed up and decided to write this review.
I already opened account in near Bank Of America in September planning to switch. Now I will be moving my business and personal accounts there completely.",1,Florida,ChIJCwK2wIp83YgRCo_rt7XVit8

My bank knows for certain that 5/3 misplaced it, and now 5/3 wants me to pay not only the amount, but a late fee. I called corporate, and rather than try and help they wasted an hour of my time without offering an acceptable way to help. I cannot stress enough how much you shouldn't bank with any 5/3 branch.",1,Florida,ChIJCwK2wIp83YgRCo_rt7XVit8

I am very disappointed of this bank, specially of the branch in four corners witch is the closest to me. One of the personal bankers got me into a 3 year contract without me knowing to an outside company called vantiv, for a credit card divise.  The branch manager Daniel is very unprofessional,  how can he be the lead of the branch when he uses sarcasm with clients, makes fun of them (look other reviews). Bottom line almost every time that I visited this branch i see them give a hard time to pleople. I can't wait to take my business to some other bank.",1,Florida,ChIJCwK2wIp83YgRCo_rt7XVit8

The offers online take you to the page to sign up for a new account with the promo link- supposedly, but after trying to open the account online it tells me I'm approved but need to go to the branch to prove my identity and finish opening the account. It's either a scam because there's no promo code in their website anywhere or they changed it because of the virus.

02/03/2024 02:07:35,Sony Abraham,"Came here to close my account after difficulty accessing funds. While I didn't wait long, I did not appreciate the teller being accusatory and claiming I was closing my account because I got the bonus already.

Yes, the bonus enticed me to open an account but after I setup direct deposit, I had no way to transfer funds to another account. Initially , I was told that I linked too many bank accounts (I only linked 1). Then I was told it was because I tried to transfer more than half the amount (I only did about 40% and it still didn't work). Finally I was told I can't transfer funds because I logged in too many times that day (I had only logged in once that day to show the issue).

At this point, it was obvious the representative was incompetent and just trying to find excuses. I told the rep I wanted to close my account if this is the kind of experience I'm in for. Right before leaving the country, I found a bank on the way to the airport and closed my account so that I could get funds added to the family account.

This bank was about a 100 miles away from my home town. If my goal was just to take the bonus, then I would have closed it much sooner at my local branch. The experience has left a sour taste in my mouth.",2,Florida,ChIJCVDsFxWH3YgRgf4uWGX3tkA

Only a few have been pleasant the rest always have an attitude, don’t understand what you’re saying, or act like they don’t want to help.

Choose chase or any other. They do not care. They make mistakes and do not fix it right away. Also in addition to this. I had three representatives from the loan department be rude and argumentative that required the supervisor assistance.

So this bank doesn't have cameras seeing me in my car with my license plate?

I was at the branch twice and Flor Jorge was the person who met with me in her office (not the counter) both times. She simply does not listen to what I say and keeps talking loudly in a rude and unprofessional manner. I have never seen a bank worker treat customers like this. I deposited my money there, but her attitude was like I owe her something. She put herself like a big authority, not a customer service person. I am surprised this type of person is allowed to work at this position. In addition, while I can access my account through online banking, the bank set a very low limit of transferring money out per day and per month. The limit is much lower than other banks. So basically, having an account there is not only inconvenient, but will also be treated badly. I closed my account and will never come back to this place again.",1,Florida,ChIJh_x8b00m2YgRwafm-GYN3qo

10/17/2023 22:29:17,Renay Layne 2,"Today, we went into the Greenacres Branch in Lake Worth to open a business checking account. We had all supporting documents to open the account. During our appt, while in an office, another employee interrupted on 3 separates occasions to let us know, that Fifth Third will not be approving our business loans and there is no need to apply for a Business Loans or request a Business Line of Credit for at least for 12-18 months in business. Then, he returned a second time and said we shouldn't apply for a business credit card for at least 3 months because we won't get approved. our business was not wanted, and no services were going to be extended to us. . I never felt so discriminated against.  After an hour in the office, we got the message. we said we want to reconsider. The man was happy to walk us to the door and said sorry but not before suggestion we should try to get a loan with the SBA of Palm Bch Co instead. I suggested a survey be sent to us to rate our experience with the Fifth Third but have not received an email yet. We left and went to Truist and TD Bank and opened (2) separate Business Accounts in the area  and got approved the same day for Business Credit Cards without any problems or discouragement. Never judge a book by its cover. We come with good credit and have paid multiple loan backs over the years with various banking institutions. This was a new business but not our first time having a business. We know the type of service that should be extended to a potential client and relationship the bank should desire to build. We were hoping to build a relationship with a local community bank but was not welcomed with open arms. Cooperate Office needs to revamp this location because all reviews can't be wrong for different reasons. Our neighbors also visited this branch a month ago and he had a similar experience and left a bad taste in his mouth. Unfortunately, they didn't know he was a New York lawyer, an investor, he  moved to Florida 1 yr ago, with capital over millions looking to invest. Again, judging people on how they look or dress.

But recently my account got hacked and I spoke to the customer service person who locked my account and told me he would send me a new card, that was april 2nd. I was told I could pick up a temporary card at one of the banking locations.  So, because ALL of my bills come out of this account I went in to get a temporary card so I could pay my bills.  I was told they couldn’t give out temporary debit cards.  So I had to pay my rent cash and some of my bills had to go unpaid.  It’s now April 29th and I still haven’t received a replacement card. So I called to figure out what going on.  The guy never ordered a replacement!!! So this new guy had to order me one to be sent within the next 5-7 business days.  Seeing as how it’s Sunday that doesnt start until tomorrow.  Also when asked if he could expedite it he said there’s a fee of $30 that I would have to pay even it’s thier fault that I am without a card for almost a month.  Btw they’ll tell you to open up an access 360 account which has a card but that card is only accepted at certain places.

I try to go in the lobby but they were only doing appointments. The lady that approached the door told me that they were only doing drive thru banking. I complained to her about the atm machine not working and she kept rolling her eyes at me and was clearly really annoyed about me complaining about the atm machine not working. With so many nice friendly people unemployed at the moment, this is the type of staff that we the people have to deal with? So unacceptable. I am a manager for a restaurant and I would never roll my eyes at a guest for being unsatisfied. DO BETTER, HIRE BETTER MANAGEMENT, TO HIRE BETTER STAFF.",1,Florida,ChIJgwev_mJj54gRn1br8aKZpjs
10/10/2020 16:01:28,Linette Velez,I called ahead to make sure they can provide change for myself due to me having a personal account with them. I was told their the phone that since the coin shortage the could not do much but I could received at lease $10.00 in Nickels  and a few rolls of quarters. When I arrived I explain to the clerk my phone call and he said he could only give me 1 roll because my account was a personal not a business account. He insisted he then mention 2 rolls but this was not what we had agreed to via phone. It seams minor issue but time is a valuable thing I would not have called ahead to confirm the quantities and gone their for only 2 rolls of coin. If you cannot help a customer and tell them the correct information when they call in then I will take my business elsewhere.,1,Florida,ChIJgwev_mJj54gRn1br8aKZpjs

They are always courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. I’ve never had a bad experience here as long as I’ve been using this branch. I even bank with 5/3 for my personal banking and my own business outside of my day job now because of this branch. The Manager David took over as my personal banker when he came to the branch and my original banker moved on to another career field, and is very knowledgeable and has always been a pleasure. Arcelie, who has been there as long as I’ve been using that branch is also very knowledgeable and helpful as well, and helped me setup my personal business account. Being that I bank with them 6 days a week for my daily deposits for my day job, and also come to them for my personal account and my own business account I can say I have extensive experience with their staff over the years and say without hesitation, I go out of my way to come to this branch, not because I’ve had issues with other branches (I am overall very pleased with 5/3 as a whole) but because their service is truly exceptional.",5,Florida,ChIJg8VdcyAXw4gRIFLuLS50ytk

12/15/2023 11:08:37,stephanie behling,"I have to say, I’m extremely disappointed by this branch for many reasons. My family has been banking with them for over 20 years and since I’ve been a client this past year, I would RUN. The first  issue I had was that one of the employees (probably Arceile Gedewoltz, my disabled mom was there) broke the key to my safe deposit box and it took them 2 weeks to get it resolved. Can you imagine not being able to get to your things during an emergency and they have nothing to say….poor customer service and what negligences.  On 12/7, I deposited my check through the ATM which I have been doing with no problems. On 12/8, I had called them and asked where my deposit was not in my account, and Arceile Gadewoltz (bank teller) was extremely disrespectful and told me that this was policy since I had one overdraft fee of $40 and my check was going to be frozen for 10 days. I keep my account up to date,  they never offered overdraft fees which I’ve always had at Wells Fargo. They never told me if I deposited my check through the ATM, my funds would be frozen for 10 days. Shame on them, this is my lively hood and my car had just been stolen from Sarasota memorial and needed these funds to get a car, ect. She was extremely rude, which made me rude. Then she called the next day and said she released the funds to my account, but guess what? She locked my debit card so that I still could not use my funds. What malice? I have never in my life experience such horrific customer service and the control that this bank teller thought she had. I’m so disgusted by her behavior and the bank it’s self. I went into the branch the following Tuesday to close out all my accounts and my security box. I would stay far away from this branch and Fifth Third Bank on Manatee Ave W, as they clearly do not care about their clients and only about the control they have over your lively hood!

01/08/2020 20:57:39,Jake Strotman,"I called in for an extensive but simple task/request that has been done by other branches of fifth third bank periodically. I had to call this branch due to travel and the lady in charge (Heather) had called back and instead of offering solution oriented advice, gave me the run around. Then when I pushed for it to be done, she had suggested that it would cost (a lot of money for said services) but could never reference a price or come up with a quote. The part that turns me off the most, I had gotten frustrated and stated I have ""a lot of accounts"" with fifth third and have been a loyal customer for many years. She replied ""I don't see where those many accounts are, I only see 2."" Which I found very unattractive.

I truly hope you value each customer the same, regardless of accounts. However no solution was reached and I am still stuck wondering what to do next.

Needless to say there are lots of other banks out there, I will definitely be exploring other options.",1,Florida,ChIJb8dnzQx754gR3ktGkDGOd7Y
06/26/2020 16:17:06,Sabrina Cline,"Absolutely the worst bank I have ever tried to open an account with. A year ago I opened a credit card with them. I showed interest in opening a checking acct at the time but chose not to. Some time passed and I got a letter in the mail with my new checking account card. Confused, I called the office and the gentlemen said he swore I said I wanted to open the acct. I never mentioned this during any of my visits because I didn't want to get the individual who did it to get in trouble because he still works there. Needless to say I never put money in the acct and the acct closed. A few months ago I went to try to utilize their free checking acct with a bonus offer of $250. They said I couldn't receive the offer because I had opened an acct almost a year ago and to come back after the year is up to take advantage of the offer. About a month ago I received a call from a bank employee saying to come in and open the acct because I'm eligible for the offer now. So in the beginning on June I came in and sat down to open the acct. After about 45 mins I was told that the offer wasn't available yet and I would have to come back AGAIN on June 26th. Well its June 26th and after sitting there for 30 mins, because they had two people working. I found out that I wasn't eligible for the offer until tomorrow and that I should just come back for a FOURTH time because they can't get their information correct.

02/25/2022 03:07:20,Oss Cev,"Nasty customer service. The teller Bianca interrupted a conversation I was having with another teller and told me ""Its in the company customer procedures"". After I told her the other branch accepted business deposits in the lobby she told me ""next time go to the other branch"".
So let me get this straight: When you have a commercial deposit and a change order you need to make two lines, one through drive through to drop the deposit off and another one inside to pick up the change order? How does this make sense? I already made one line why should I have to make two? And it would have been a simple resolution if Bianca would have said, I am sorry but the deposit are dropped and change orders picked up inside but since you already made the line inside I will drop those deposits off for you. Thank you!
I asked to speak to the manager Bobby Roeheig and the person did not dignified themselves with giving a call back. No wonder the customer service is horrible, because there is no accountability for their bad behaviors and the manager is just as bad.
And the worst thing? Try making a customer complaint. there is no phone option, no email option, nothing. That's why I personally do not use this bank. If you are a glutton for bad customer service then use Fifth Third.",1,Florida,ChIJQxxI2fZ254gRQTd-z6PdB3Q

04/11/2016 23:23:07,doghousemine,"I had to get a notary signature on a document, in a hurry.    The credit union my account is at closed its branch here some years ago.    So rather ride across town to go to my own bank to get a notary signature I had to find someone else who would do so locally.   Fortunately 5 th. 3 rd. bank was right down the road.

The people at this branch were very warm, friendly and helpful.      Everyone in the branch said hello and greeted me upon entering.   The branch manger, Ms. Parido, made time to take care of my document.   Later I discovered I needed another document signed as well and I called her.   She returned my call promptly and invited me to come down to the office again.    After a short 5 minute wait, as she was helping a branch customer, she welcomed me into her office again.    After she read the document she signed it and all was well.

She did ask me where I banked and gave me some information that I said I would like to have.     I have to admit when I change banking, which I will do soon probably, I will be glad to take my account to this bank location.     Too seldom are people in banks friendly like they used to be.

Realmente deberían copiar a las Sucursales de Kissimmee, Poinciana o Treasure Island, EXCELENTE ATENCIÓN Y ASESORAMIENTO EN TODAS ELLAS.

And I have cashed checks at this bank from other customers before today. The north Port location litteraly looked at the check and told me no. The lazy tellers didn't bother to look up her account or to Ask a supervisor. Didn't even touch a computer or anything. All the said is there protecting their customers account. I said to them, but the lady wrote what the check was for and she signed it, and they still refused to do anything. Horrible customer service here, there wasn't a single other customer in the bank while I was there. Everyone was standing around and talking, and to top it off they don't do anything except refuse to do their one job, be a bank teller. I even asked if the policy applied at all locations and they ensured me that the policies are all the same.... Now their being super lazy, and really refusing to do their jobs. I immediately drove 10 miles to the next location, walked in and asked the teller there if they could cash the same check. The teller there asked her manager what she could do, and they called the maker of the check to verify the check and the amount. Once it was verifyed the cashed the check and I was on my way.  Not only is the location lazy, the employees haven't a clue what the company policys are, they also have no clue what customer service means. And now I'm out of gas money for driving 10 miles farther, and back, I'm also out of an hour of my time. Thanks a lot fifth third Bank, for giving me the worst experience I've ever had banking!

08/30/2021 16:48:20,Azim M,"This bank will put you at risk financially. It has been my experience that they have no interest in customer service and are only reactive to your issues. If you attempt to address the issue, they will provide you with an empty apology for your experience, but not for their actions and will take no action to actually resolve any issue you might have.

Providing a bit more detail here. We attempted to perform a wire transfer in order to close on a property. After planning ahead and contacting ahead, this branch did not inform us that capability was not in service or not working, they didn't inform me that they wouldn't be able to actually complete the transfer, they just sat on the transfer. When trying to understand what was going on with my transfer, all i received was apathy and attitude. Cool, i ended up liquidating my assets with this bank and moved on.

When I received my card, my account balance wasn’t visible in the app. Needless to say I removed my money and was charged an overdraft. 5/3 charges DAILY overdraft for my type of account. Also, Covid-19 is happening during this banking nightmare. Worst financial mistake I ever made in my life was coming here.

Went to the branch on Buford highway which is larger, better looking, and technological, and they helped me Instsntly despite not having an appointment.

12/04/2023 16:40:19,Facing East,"Lindbergh Plaza Branch. 5/3 gives the option to start an account online. I took the option and entered in my information as the system requested and the system set a follow-up appointment by phone. On the scheduled date and time, no one called me, so I followed up an hour later and the representative was rude and had no clue what I was talking about and said, 'we don't do appointments early in the morning, and it's already 11:00', indicating that I'm the one that was late. Well, their system gave me the option to set it, and it was for 10:00 a.m. if you can call that early, and I was the one that was supposed to receive the call! She then said they don't make those types of appointments [for new accounts] over the phone. It was the website that set the appointment and gave me the appointment option, with a confirmation number and everything, including an email reminder. If this is any indication of how 5/3 does business, it's a definite no go for me! In my opinion the branch could have at least called to cancel out of consideration instead of being a no show.",1,Georgia,ChIJcQ9PLOgF9YgRtlnt2g4NQGc

They didn't even bother to inform me or email me about this and I had to call to know that the cheque was not processed and put on hold, now I have to make late payments because I have to wait for the cheque to be processed for another day and my monthly payments are due.

I'd rather chew frozen glass than deal with this nonsense. Glad I didn't waste my time driving all the way up to the actual location. Probably would have stroked out from the obvious incompetency and lack of professionalism right then and there.

01/22/2020 20:05:31,Katie H,This bank apparently only allows one customer at a time inside and there is some strange green and red light which tells you when you can go inside which did not seem to be working (I stood outside for about 5 minutes and no one saw me?). There was an outdated sign on the front door saying the bank was closed for a holiday that had already passed. Instead of being able to make a deposit with a teller I had to use the ATM which is causing a delay with my deposit. Overall this bank gives a terrible first impression to an existing customer and I certainly won’t return to this branch.

05/21/2023 08:58:54,Thanni O Thannni,"Dear Fifth Third Bank,

I am writing this review to express my disappointment with the service I received at your branch located at this location. I visited your bank to open a business account, and the experience was nothing short of frustrating and unprofessional.

Upon entering the bank, I was greeted by a lady in the second room on the left hand side who informed me that she could not open a business account for me because I did not show her my CDL license. I was taken aback by this request, as I had provided her with all the necessary documents, including my certificate of incorporation, my ID, and my EIN, all printed right in front of her.

I failed to understand why my CDL license was relevant to opening a business account. This request was unnecessary, and it only served to waste my time and cause me unnecessary inconvenience.

The lady's attitude was also unprofessional and unwelcoming. She did not offer any explanation for her request and did not apologize for the inconvenience caused. Her lack of empathy and customer service skills left a lot to be desired.

Overall, my experience at your branch was disappointing, and I would not recommend your services to anyone looking to open a business account. I hope that you will take the necessary steps to improve your customer service and ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

Sincerely,",1,Georgia,ChIJ_4gSA0oD9YgRCO5QPLNQ2Rs

The tellers were pleasant and very welcoming.  While waiting don't hold your breathe for any refreshments. The guy came out and then went back in his office. I,3,Georgia,ChIJ_4gSA0oD9YgRCO5QPLNQ2Rs
06/08/2023 19:26:35,Lisa Pluckebaum,DO NOT GO HERE. This bank is the worst. Waited forever to get a CD and the girl didn’t know what she was doing. Then I got 4 calls back to back from a manager two weeks later. Finally left a VM. It’s because her team member messed up. I would not trust this bank with my life.,1,Georgia,ChIJ_4gSA0oD9YgRCO5QPLNQ2Rs
03/21/2023 16:27:42,almendra parra,"Worst bank experience ever . I really wasted my time coming here . First I was on hold for 30 mins (the time it took me to drive there) I got there and asked why no one answered because no one was there but me. I wanted to ask what I needed to cash my check because I didn’t have an account with them.
Then I went through the whole processes of making a profile and at the VERY end she tells me there’s a $100( I’m guessing 10% fee)  charge for cashing my check even though it’s from this bank…. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH A PHONE CALL. The staff needs more training and you can tell people hate their job here . Not to mention the rude remarks made by whoever is in the back rooms .

Prior to traveling 30 minutes to 5/3 Bank I called the bank on SW Cascade in Atlanta
I spoke with Fredricka who was very professional and answered my questions about opening a new account with the bonus. She advised we could come in today or come in the morning.
My family and I arrived at 615 to open 3 accounts the banker was rude, unprofessional and non caring.
Christopher just wasn’t interested he advise we could come back tomorrow, he advised even though they remain open til 7 they have back up work to do.
After I told him he was rude he explained about the system goes down at 5pm.
Maybe Fredricka should be the banker and Christopher should take some customer service classes.",1,Georgia,ChIJ_4gSA0oD9YgRCO5QPLNQ2Rs

Teller took the check and went behind the door and immediately  came back and she said check is not verifiable ( check was from another major bank !!!) and told me to use my online banking to deposit it. l left the branch and drove it to Sidney Marcus location.

It had a $250 checking account bonus and i was following up with Justin on the timeline on when I can expect to get it. There was one problem - due to a bank charge that was levied on my account my balance became less than $500 a requirement for the checking bonus. When I called Justin, he said he will take care of it and submit a request to process my bonus and that I will receive my bonus in 7 working days. This was in mid february. I followed up after a week, same response. And then after i called 2-3 weeks later, he stopped taking my calls nor returned my calls after leaving a message. The net result was waste of my time in expectations that I will get the bonus, whereas all that Justin did was empty promises and wasting my time.

First time on a walk in and was told by a polite gentleman someone will call me back. No call. Few days later I called and they tried to transfer me to him, but he was with a customer. Appointment set at a later time and was expecting a callback. Well, no callback from Andy. One week later, still no phone calls. I'm not trying to beg you or to chase you down to refi my mortgage because there are tons of other mortgage companies out there.  Horrible experience before I'm even a customer. Great job guys.

I was never able to speak with a manager bc they just kept connecting me with the same teller that I had a problem with.",1,Georgia,ChIJkV7JnSPG9YgRA14OHYVBEBA
02/21/2023 17:32:43,Shelby Roberson,"One start is tooooo much.  This bank doesn't care  about their customers money.  I spoke with the lady at the Loganville location about a ACH transaction being taking from my account.  I was told that I could pay $35.00 to stop the transaction, I was also told that it was so close to the deduction date that it may not take effect in January, but going forward the amount wouldn't be deducted from our account.  WELL!!!!  they allowed the amount to be deducted in February.  I contacted the branch manager at the Loganville location to be told, sorry the other lady made a mistake when she gave me incorrect information and they can't protect my account against this merchant.  I'm being told that I will have to dispute it (which I will) and wait to see if the bank will give me back the funds.  The whole issue the merchant that keeps taking the money from our account has been paid off. (I know that's another issues I'm working on).  I thought my money was protected with 5th 3rd bank, but I have found out and was told today it's not.",1,Georgia,ChIJkV7JnSPG9YgRA14OHYVBEBA

She's always smiling and happy to see you and promptly gets you in and out. The branch manager Paul K. Is awesome. He will definitely go above and beyond to make sure your taking care of and any issues are solved. I had a issue with setting up my new pre rewards account for my new card and he escalated it for me and a nice young lady named Ana C. contacted me and she also went above and beyond for me getting there Tech department involved. She called and emailed me keeping me informed the whole process through.  She was nice and friendly always keeping the best customer service possible.  And they are able to go back to day 1 and issue my points based on what I used my card for. Im definitely a happy customer and would recommend 5/3 bank to anyone. Especially webb gin branch.

06/16/2014 15:14:28,Kali Daniels,"worst bank in the world! rudest customer service!!! the level of incompetence makes me question how they have stayed in business. I called with a concern about my money in my account and the woman kept talking over me telling me about a policy. I am NOT a policy! I could not even voice my concerns for she was talking over me telling me about the policies. I don't care about the policies. I'm not a policy are you a policy are you an intangible thing? No, your human being that put your money and trust into your bank. now they're going to hold on to my money an extra 24 hours because of their policy all the while earning interest of my money!!!
when I first signed up for my bank account my name was spelled incorrectly. I tried to get a loan a year ago and they went through the worst possible choice that they could have. of course I was denied but when I went to my credit union they knew exactly what to do and I got a loan exactly how I wanted it, that day.
the bank would not provide me with the decent customer service line so I could speak with someone higher up in the branch beside the teller.
the only way I can make complaint as if I write a letter and put it in the snail mail and then wait for their snail mail response. that does not sound like proper due diligence to me!
go to any other bank or credit union. do not go to the small rinky dink -hold your money as long as possible -so they can earn interest and tell you that their policies onto a customer with this distain.
go to Wells Fargo, the brand bank, get a credit union account do not open account here. I have had an account with them for over 2 years and this is how I get treated, rudely no due diligence and policies- intangible policies. in my mind my money now stolen.  my money stolen for next to 24 hours to make interest off of it. for a policy I was not even aware of!
Fine you hold my money over a policy and be that unyielding, fine  do it but treat me with some respect!!!!! I have worked places where there are policies and I know that there's always a way they just didn't want to provide the way so now I'm going to close my account. I will not give my money to a bank that is this rude to me.
and I will find a phone number of someone to complain to that does not require me to send in a letter that can actually talk to me if they can take my money than they can talk to me!
this is a wretched horrible rude undiplomatic evil bank.

11/14/2019 20:54:58,Miss Hawthorne,"I have come to this location sparingly over the years. My most recent visit was in Aug 2019. I came to get a temp debit card due to mine being stolen & awaiting a replacement. Valencia assisted me & everything went well. She followed up a week or so later to ensure that I had received my card to which I replied that I did. It was a nice gesture and I thought that was the end. HOWEVER, the calls continue, even to this day. On 10/24/19, someone illegally deposited a $2,000 check into my account at that location—conveniently the same day I also had 2 missed calls from Valencia as well. After initiating the dispute process I contacted the branch and asked to speak w/ the manager, who is Aaron. I inquired how in the hell someone could make such a deposit into my account, especially with the security measures they (SHOULD) have in place. He non chalantly “assured” me that the dispute process would render the proper results etc. I also asked him why Valencia called me, to which he had no answer. On SATURDAY 11/9/2019, at 8:30am (BEFORE THE BANK EVEN OPENED), another missed call from Valencia. I immediately contact the 800 number to advise them of my concerns that more fraudulent activity could be occurring on my account. I asked if they knew why she would be contacting me, especially that damn early, & if there were notations on my account. The rep replied that there weren’t & they proceeded to try to contact Valencia themselves to see why she called. The rep comes back to the phone & stated that Valencia refused to speak with them, & she proceeded to call me again. I have ZERO desire to speak with her and have ignored every one of her calls since August. I have since been keeping a close eye on my account until I am able to close it for good. I have reason to believe Valencia & Aaron have a hand in playing with peoples money/accounts. The building is probably 50+ years old and lacks proper surveillance and security features so there’s no telling what all they do/have done. Oh...and what prompted my review today—-two missed calls from Valencia on 11/13/19 and 11/14/19. This situation is really weird & I would advise everyone to NOT DO BUSINESS HERE!!!",1,Georgia,ChIJJ2tn8Oyg9YgRjZ7v7NfA_mM

They make their own customer feel like fraud, asking me their client why the check is electronically signed!?  I have no idea I didn’t print the check!  Also, absolutely wasted my time, they asked me questions about the check for 30 minutes, said their processor wasn’t there and told me to come back.  I came back later, wasted about 50 minutes and no help. I went to another brand and they deposited my check in 10 minutes and it was available for use the next day and passed all the banks security clearances as it was real.",1,Georgia,ChIJJ2tn8Oyg9YgRjZ7v7NfA_mM

When we first deposited a large sum into this bank for funding, they wanted to hold our funds for 14 days! 14 days! This prevented us from purchasing equipment and supplies for our new company. Now, we are five months in and they held yet another large deposit, telling us it's because we are a new account. They also could not tell us when we cease being considered a new account. The check that was being held was written by SUNTRUST. Suntrust is a huge bank that should not have it's funds held.

Anyway, I started a new job down the street from this terrible branch, and dropped by to get a direct deposit form directly from them so I didnt run the risk of making a mistake myself. WELL, the branch manager printed it for me, which ended up having the WRONG routing number. Payday comes around, and guess who did not get paid? ME. Guess who also had multiple large Bill's auto withdrawed from my account the day I was SUPPOSE to be paid? Also me.
I called customer service and explained the situation only to be told to ""wait until tomorrow to see if it deposits"". When in reality they initiated the return of my paycheck to my employer which takes 3 business days (why they lied to me is unknown).
That day I opened a new bank account with Chase bank, and will never return to 53 bank.

Anytime I’ve been there the employees have been polite and helpful. One of the most recent times I went there, I asked if I can use the restroom and the employee Brittany unlocked the restroom for me with no issue. Today when I went to the bank a friend tagging along and she asked if she could use the restroom. Jennifer looked her up and down then stated “we don’t have a restroom” I stated “that’s weird because you all had a restaurant last week” she then stated “oh corporate said no can use the restroom” my friend and I where discussing amongst ourselves how that doesn’t make sense because sometimes bank transactions can be long and they can’t expect someone to not use the restroom for however long it may take them. Jennifer then interrupted us then stated “I already said corporate said no one can use the restroom and this is pretty common” I replied “I’ve managed hotels throughout the US and have been to several banks and this has never occurred. Please stop talking to me about it I’ll just call corporate and complain” she then stated “Oh you work for _____ I’ll call him” insinuating retaliation I stated “NO I don’t work for ____ but call who you please I’m not at work you are and I’m not antagonizing a customer you are” after asking her several times to stop speaking to me she kept repeating herself or saying “happy holidays” in a very condescending tone. She then called corporate security once I left the bank! As if I posed some sort of threat! Good thing I recorded the entire interaction!

06/15/2023 02:12:17,Hiro Santiago,"My recent encounter with Elise Hatcher at Fifth Third Bank left me thoroughly disappointed and frustrated. Despite being fully qualified and having all my necessary documentation in order, the Elise Hatcher denied my request to open a business account.

I had taken the time to gather all the required documents, including my business registration, tax identification number, and personal identification, to ensure a smooth and efficient process. However, the Elise Hatcher seemed disinterested and unhelpful right from the start.

When I sought clarification on the reasons for the denial, Elise Hatcher provided vague and unsatisfactory explanations, lacking any transparency or clear guidance. It was incredibly frustrating to be left in the dark without any specific feedback on how to rectify the situation.

I had chosen Fifth Third based on their reputation for customer service and support for local businesses. Unfortunately, my experience with the bank manager was far from satisfactory. Its disheartening to be met with such incompetence and dismissiveness.

Elise Hatcher's refusal to allow me to open a business account, despite meeting all the necessary qualifications, is simply unacceptable.

01/12/2024 20:54:06,Tristan Mills,Staff is always very helpful each time I come here and went above and beyond to help me cash a check compared to the other fifth third banks in the Atlanta/Metro Atlanta area. I needed a certain amount available for a car I was trying to get that day and if it wasn’t for them I would’ve had a hard time getting the cash I needed that day if not any of it at all. Every other location told me different info about the process and the two ladies there that day went through the proper channels and the right steps and did everything they could to make sure I got taken care of.,5,Georgia,ChIJnSlo-_8Q9YgRS2-bE8NTgMg

Now they won’t show any professionalism, especially the branch manager who I’ve asked to speak to twice and I’ve never heard back and he’s never identified himself. They won’t respond to emails from the receiving bank or myself.

I had my debit card information stolen and charges over 400.00 were made in CALIFORNIA. I immediately contacted the bank and cancelled the card and filed a dispute. I have yet to get a resolution and pending transactions are going through including the fraudulent transactions and 5/3 has DONE NOTHING but read disclaimers. My other bank accounts will immediately alert me if there are any suspicious transactions on my cards and will decline it until I approve it. Not this bank....... A 276.00 dollar change for dinner in California and I have to sit 7/10 days for a resolution while the account accrues all types of fees. I am a disabled veteran and should have not trusted this bank and utilized my Navy Federal as Primary.  NEVER AGAIN. Once this issue has been resolved, I will be closing this account.

The second is a collection of horrible business management. She was overdrawn for a monthly subscription payment that she had cancelled prior to the fee. The bank's response? ""Watch your account better."" So she decided she'd have to bite the bullet and pay the overdrawn amount and, who would've thought, the ATM's were conveniently ""unable to process her request.""

She then stated that i needed to have a different Ga license that she could accept i then stated that i just renewed my license and as you see that it is a Ga license this is the same license that was good enough to open the account why is it a problem now the entire time she was very disrespectful i could tell by the look on the other two tellers face that they were ashamed of her actions and that the information she gave was not correct.. Mind you i had 6 other cards with my name on them not wanting to give into her wanting me to act out i politely asked for my documents i went right to the Customer desk in krogers were  in minutes the young lady helped me....I say this all to say be careful who has control of your money I will never go back there!!!!!!,1,Georgia,ChIJa0o0saVq9YgRZM8N2e6UbhI

I have been nothing but nice to them n never cause an issue except for what they prefer me to do. As a business customer, I have the right to use the night drop or not and they are not my bosses so they can’t tell me what method to use to make my deposit.

But you can't buy groceries etc that way. I called the 800# to discuss options, I was told that the debit cards would be delivered in 7-10 business days. If I need cash I would have to wait until a branch opens on 12/27. The agent I spoke with was useless and seemed to think my issue was funny.

08/25/2023 23:59:07,LAEL HUGHES,"Clueless, the personal bankers here are clueless. I’m not disgruntled but I’m extremely irritated for my time being wasted. I applied for a personal loan for 50k. I have an 800+ credit score and zero credit card debt and I have a 6 figure income, no negatives at all that would prevent me from obtaining a loan. I asked what was the max amount I could apply for, at this time it would’ve been great to let me know the limit for people that don’t bank with 5/3 is caped at 10k. Also they had me come in the bank when this could’ve been taken care of over the phone. I care that they wasted my time and added another hard inquiry to my report. This isn’t cool. And it wasn’t cool that the personal banker didn’t understand how interest rates work, I nearly ran out the door when she added the prime rate twice and quoted me over 20% APR… YIKES.  This all occurred over two visits with two differ bankers I have to add. A little transparency and a little more training can go a long way. And Whoever from 5/3 that will review this review, please email me if you think any part of this review is false. I’d be more than happy to confirm this with the appropriate documentation. I’d love to show you how I went to another bank that same evening and underwriting approved me the very same day with a lower Interest. Special thanks to US Bank in Geneva IL.

05/16/2023 20:08:56,Brian Watkins,"I've been banking at this location for the past 2 or 3 banks before it became Fifth Third. I moved out of state last year, but was still banking with 53. My family decided to buy a house, and needed to wire transfer the closing costs to our title company. I called and talked to Melina Carlon on 2 different occasions. The first time I talked to her, she told me there was no way that they can do a wire transfer for me unless I am physically in the branch location. I explained that this was not possible as I live in another state. Melina then suggested that I open a bank account in my new state and write a check to deposit the money.

I followed her advice, but the new bank put a hold on the transfer (they US Bank, have been extremely helpful in getting this hold removed so I can finish closing, thank God).

When I went back to Melina, and pressed her on why she couldn't do the wire transfer, she messaged her boss Deborah Wheeler. Instead of hearing back from Deborah, like I requested, Melina called me back and said that she CAN now do the wire transfer (mind you the money is still pending transfer to the new bank). She asks me to sign and fax back a copy of the wire transfer form along with my drivers license. I send this to her, and she emails me back with a transaction number to give my title company.

That transfer never happened. The following Monday, I emailed Melina back and she informed me that something happened, and she need a new signature with todays date. By this time, the money had left my 53 account, so I asked her how she was going to do a wire transfer for me when there was no money in the account for it?

She told me if I put the money back in the account she could help me. Unfortunately, it's too late for that.

I sent a message with all of this to her boss Deborah, didn't get a response.

Had Melina just tried to help me in the first place, instead of brushing me off on another bank, I would have moved into my house yesterday. As it stands, we are still waiting for the funds to fully clear so that I can close on my house.

As a side story, I tried many times to get any kind of help from their online customer service. They would only insist that the branch location was the only one that could help me.

I wouldn't recommend this branch or this bank to anyone.",1,Illinois,ChIJlallu3XlDogR0yVtQBFDABo

02/13/2019 01:18:34,Priscilla Anne Evans,I shared an checking account with my daughter years ago. My checks were direct deposit into my account and one month the bank teller did not let us know which checks cleared the previous day. We thought all of them were accounted for and the balance was accurate but one check did not go through until the following day so our account was showing a negative balance due. Long story short at the end of the day the bank took responsibility for the mistake and we were not charged for the mix up. No other bank that I know of has ever been this helpful. It is nice to know that they have the integrity to take ownership of their mistakes and not pass it on to their clients. Kudos,4,Illinois,ChIJlallu3XlDogR0yVtQBFDABo

When I was talking to Jake as to why this is the Finacial Center manager Melina came over saying that I needed to go to the other Auarua location as that is where I created my first account.

So when she noticed she asked me to verify my ssn which I gave to her and she retrieved the correct acct number. She had to gain authorization from her manager to a withdrawal of that amount. I get to the office and the manager asks me if the money on the account was mine or my mother's? And how come my address is in Chicago and I'm coming to Aurora for a withdrawal? Just moved to Aurora and it's my money. Didn't know those were security/verification questions but ok.
Tells me that my new ID has a number incorrect on it. I'm like ok thanks... didn't notice that. Luckily, I still had my old ID that I began the account with that was not expired. She tells me to proceed to another bank because she won't approve of the withdrawal and I should go to the dmv to get an update ID. Really?

He failed to understand that POA of property includes bank accounts even though the paperwork explained it right there. His ego was so great that he spoke over me every chance he had and refused to consider the failed logic of his own words.  Fifth third had already approved me as POA for my uncle based on the paperwork I submitted two days ago. But as the previous POA was on one of the accounts, EPPS stated he would only add me to the other accounts and not that one. He claimed he needed a signed statement from the previous POA that he no longer wanted to be POA. I was confused as to how the written request of my uncle to add me as POA did not take precedence. He asked rhetorically (because he was never speaking with me, just at me), ""how am I supposed to justify a year from now why you are on there and not the other POA?"" I responded, ""By the fact that I brought in NEW POA documents that are dated after the previous POA paperwork."" He shook his head as I spoke and said, ""It doesn't work like that"". I could not believe his lack of insight. I asked him, ""What other way can my uncle remove the previous POA other than with this document?"" He said by writing a letter that he revokes him.  I asked, ""How does this paperwork not state that?""  He said for me to show him where it says that and he would look at it. He passed me the paperwork that he CLEARLY did not read himself and there it was, ""I [my uncle's name] hereby revoke all prior statutory powers of attorney for property executed by me..."" I showed him. He grabbed it, glanced at it, and said, ""That's for property, not for bank accounts"". I asked, ""How does this POA of property paperwork, that YOUR institution verified and approved, authorize me as POA for his other bank accounts, but not this one?"" Again he said, ""That's not for bank accounts, just real estate."" I tried to show him where the document includes financial transactions, but he just kept shaking his head and talking over me. I told him I wanted to speak to his superior. I had had enough. It was ridiculous. I didn't even want to get added on the other accounts at this branch anymore. He then pushed the signature cards in front of me and said, ""Oh no. You are going to sign these! We already did all the work,"" and stepped away. The ONLY reason I signed the cards was because of the immediate need to help my uncle and bc the banker, Becky, had remained calm and professional the entire time, handing me a pen and respectfully instructing me on where I needed to sign and how.  Eventually, of course, someone did correct him. I don't know who he called, but all of a sudden his demeanor changed and he stopped puffing his chest like the pompous know-it-all he had been acting like. He EVENTUALLY did apologize, but his condescending attitude made this whole experience so much more stressful than it needed to be. And it was clear the apology was not sincere. I told him that I hope he realizes that going forward he should treat clients differently, let them finish their question before just speaking over them, and that he should consider what they are saying before just rejecting it and acting the way he did. Of course the whole time I'm saying this not once did he make any eye contact. He just kept clicking the mouse on his computer, making his apology empty and perfunctory. I continued by saying that I worked very briefly in banking before and one of the reasons it was brief was because I found it to be an environment where men are too often extremely condescending to women. It's unfortunate to see this pattern still remains. I recommend that any women seeking banking assistance DO NOT patronize this branch as long as EPPS is the managing banker. His example is not one that should be followed.",1,Illinois,ChIJ8dTBkv47DogRcAlxb4e1ePc

Everyone inside there is always very helpful and anytime I have ever had an issue caused by another branch they waste no time in resolving it.

06/19/2018 16:42:36,Yolie Rivera,"negative stars if possible. let me make this as brief as possible ONLY because I want to warn anyone even considering this incompetent bank. my husband and i married and decided to leave our chase accounts separate and begin anew with 5/3 HUGE MISTAKE. Not only did they 'lose' our $2,000 xmas cash deposit into their own bank ATM they blamed the ATM company saying we should call them (we had receipt and camera taping of us depositing it) they assured no fees would apply until they 'located' weeks later. charged us fees during the interim that they'd credit later & after only we had to call and complain about after the month long delay... then my hubby still being hopeful still keeps account open only to deposit a huge amount last week $9,000 for home repairs only to NOT have it available to us after we start paying our bills due to 'punishment' for past January fees. which are.. yes.. the late fees from the $2,000 ($500 or so) that they lost in the first place. No bank should punish anyone and much less holding their $9,000 hostage when bills are due much less when it was their fault in the first place. Who loses money? Especially when you're a bank. So, if you want to deposit money and pay your bills and think 5/3 can do that for you.. good luck!",1,Illinois,ChIJM2_A8eU2DogR7rKZ7_vsVUg

So it's for every 2 success there will be a chance of failure once. 2:1. There is no need for an atm to have that ratio at all. All it does is waste time. This bank is on my eta, but I'd prefer to go to the on 91st and Cicero. Way better and efficient. Never had a problem there and already been there over 20 times. Where there were zero failures.

12/14/2023 19:58:26,Andrea Moore,This location although looks nice is very inhumane! The fact that customers and clients are not able to use the bathroom regardless how long you are made to wait or regardless how long you sit with a banker is ridiculous. The the suggestion to walk or drive to a gas station is absurd! I hope many others speak on this because it is not fair nor is it in line with the core values 53rd stands behind,1,Illinois,ChIJxxUd-VP3DogRlUBOasHXsxY

I've been backing with Fidth Third for almost 5 months now and they have not let me down once. Manuel the Personal Banker is a huge help and is always checking in on his customers as well as goes above and beyond with giving options to help his customers. I highly recommend banking here and if you do ask for Manuel,5,Illinois,ChIJxxUd-VP3DogRlUBOasHXsxY
12/12/2020 21:38:18,Akiya C,"I was at the location on Ogden in Aurora. The address is 2998 Ogden Ave. I was at the bank at 1:55 drove to the drive-through, all signs were closed. When I pull back around the front, the guy was locking the door. I knocked on the door and mentioned that the bank should not be closed until 2 PM, he signaled me to go away as if I was nobody. I said that I was calling corporate and ask for his name, he hide his name tag, stared at me and walked away. A girl came walking out at exactly 2pm to go home. I sat in my car to call corporate. I was on hold for too long and drove away while still on hold. Someone answered shortly after and asked me the address so I drove back around because I wasn't too far. I got out of my car looking for the address on the door and he came out between the double doors and started recording me and my Car plate as if I did something wrong.
I'm not as upset at the fact of them closing early as I am with how I was dismissed and treated like I did something wrong with no explanation. He could've made up a reason for them closing early and I would've been fine. But he just waived me away as if I was nobody. I am a customer and was treated like a criminal. It’s Christmas and I was trying to access a little cash to buy a gift for a loved one. Communication goes a long way, and that’s not waiving someone away like an animal. I would like the video of me and my car deleted from his phone immediately and for the staff to be coached on customer service, and proper branch closing procedures... In today’s world, I can easily say that I felt a bit discriminated against because Im a black woman, wearing a head scarf, with sweats and tennis shoes on, and wonder if I was of another race, dressed differently, if that would’ve made a difference in how I was treated, but I won’t pull that card because our country has already been through enough. However; this team definitely needs to be coached on proper customer service and not taking it upon themselves to set their own business hours because they want to go home early. I’ve never had a good experience here, but it’s never been this bad. The service experiences I have had, speaks to the expectations and leadership of their direct manager, and because the guy hide his name, I don’t know who to make a complaint against.",1,Illinois,ChIJxxUd-VP3DogRlUBOasHXsxY

01/05/2024 01:32:50,Ace,"At 53rd they have managed to do 53 percent of things wrong. For starters, they put my last name correctly on the debit card I got, but they put her maiden name on her card after the Banker Jasmine had her sign paperwork to correct the name that was on her older account. Long story short she never got her card after chatting almost every day about how much they suck. Someone finally got it escalated and I assume they will send the card later with the correct name now that it’s update in the app. Limited on how much you can Zelle with new account. 500 per month for new accounts and it can get up to 4000 per month after the account has been opened 181 days. Not very forthcoming with that limitation. It took them almost two weeks to clear my check for 6,000 bucks. The put it on hold and it will be ready on 1/5 as long as the funds are there. Well capital on release the funds with two days. The funds have been taken out of my account I wrote the check from.  I was attempting to leave a bank that didn’t have any local branches for a bank that did, and this was a mistake. I will be closing all my accounts and I will need my money in cash. I’ll be taking my funds to BMO. I just would have appreciated the banker we sat down with to my our goals a priority. I would have never gave them my check if I knew it would take two weeks. I been with my current back for over ten years and never had an issue with checks never reported fraud before. I just been a good customer. 53rd treatment made me feel like they were helping me avoid fees if the check didn’t clear. This is standard procedure and to show you how bogus little 53 bank is. My wife got a check for 3800 we were able to use the app to deposit the check it it was all available the next day. At 53rd you cannot deposit that amount the limitation are unspeakable I hope they don’t just do black people like this. So Saturday I will need my 8330.00 in cash.

You can call the 800 number but you CANNOT CALL THE LOCAL BRANCH.  Forget about it.  Don't waste your time.

The whole reason to open a checking account is to avoid complications when cahsing checks from OTHER services) they charge a percentage based fee.

I walked in to this branch, and before I could even request a service, the white male manager IMMEDIATELY puts me off to the minority female bank teller, Rosa. For context, I am also a minority.

Rosa was either insanely socially awkward or had prejudiced beliefs about the customer she was serving. Either way, Rosa was visibly trembling, stumbling over her words in nervousness, as she asked for my information to open a new bank account.

It felt like Rosa’s first time opening any new account. This made the experience frustrating and lackluster. To add, Rosa was not clear about what I could expect in the near future in terms of access to my account funds. I left the branch without any access to my funds, pending a debit card delivery in approx. two weeks.

Do NOT bank at this particular branch. If you have no choice, try NOT to bank with teller Rosa.",1,Illinois,ChIJFVqk1747d4gRFzBfQEHxQlo

One of the 100 dollar bills they gave me turned out to be counterfeit. Two tellers at Triumph Community Bank in Moline, IL spoke to a teller named Dave at the Sterling branch and he left a message for the manager. The manager did not speak to me until 5 days later and after three phone calls and told me there is no way I can prove the bill came from their bank.  I have banked with them for 11 years. I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that they not only stole my money but that the manager did not seem to be concerned that they are circulating fake money.

4/11/23 I had previously been very unhappy with this branch. But today, I went there again for a document to be notarized and Kristen Birdwell notarized the document for me rightaway and I was very pleased with the service. Thank you",4,Indiana,ChIJaXDRS8yvFIgRR-1szRyJzJM

It has gotten messed up every single time.  This branch doesn't seem to be able to get anything right.  We started this whole process pre-pandemic, so they can't use that as an excuse.

I don't want to edit the previous review, because it was accurate.  BUT, over the last few years, this branch has really made a 180, and I would rate it 5 star now.  I've gone into the branch probably 30 times over the last 2 years, and have been happily greeted every, single time.  I've had to conduct many different types of transactions, and they were able to help with all of it on the spot.

12/22/2022 22:57:47,Matthew Green,"This is the finest team of employees ever assembled! From the bottom all of the way up. The branch is very clean, and the atmosphere is very casual, including the lighting. I have been a member of this branch for about 5 months, and didn't have any bank accounts for many years, due to my unfortunate outcomes with another Fifth/Third branch far from here. Cash app banking held me down for quite some time, and I still use them. But the need to have a real account, and my location brought me back to the West Washington location. I was very weary of starting an account with this company, but I must say, I have been very impressed with the entire team, their professionalism, and their ability to create harmony through teamwork, and I have never appreciated that moreso than I do now. My maturity has me trying to establish credit, and Fifth/Third has given me the ability to do that with their program, that allows you to establish just that, by only starting a second account and putting a balance in savings, and then they simply send a credit card with a limit, and each time you pay your balance back, it raises you score a little, and occasionally raises your limits to a higher level. It was too easy, and very needed by me. The branch takes security very seriously, and you will be faced with the metal detector at the entrance, but you simply empty your pockets of unneeded personal effects, prior to entering the building. When you enter, stop walking while facing the inner door, you will be scanned automatically, and then you will see the green light on the doorframe in front of you. Then you enter. It's that simple. You will inconvenience yourself if your pockets or purse/bookbag etc. are full of metal objects. After my first visit, I have never had any problems. So don't let your first time falling off of your bicycle prevent you from enjoying your experience in the future. It's for our safety as well. And it's absolutely necessary.

I passed by the branch to make quick transaction, as I have business meeting in couple hours later!
the banker issue me new prepaid card as i lost my original card, and i asked to make sure card is activate though, the amount has been transferred according to her.
Two hours later my new card was declined time after another ?
i and up missing my deal cuz there's no enough $ in it to make the purchase cuz the transaction wasn't done from the beginning !

I and up losing my deal, and $200 of the trip expenses on top of that, and I had to drive for more than two hours back home to come back tomorrow maybe with better chance .

I called the next morning to trace my money I've been told we apologize for the inconvenience 😏and you should allowed 24 to 48 hours only to review their worker mistakes WTH!!😤

10/18/2023 21:48:04,Abby Davis,"I had a very questionable experience here today. I brought in a cashiers check for $3500 and attempted to cash it. The teller took the check and my information, then proceeded to tell me the check had been written from a closed account and that it was fraudulent. I returned to my vehicle —without my check or money— to try and figure out what was going on. I reached out to the person who wrote me the check and he was just as upset and confused as I was as. After a few minutes, I got a call from the teller informing me they made a mistake. The check was fine and I apparently just needed to cash it at my own bank.

I hate to be a Karen, but this was a mistake that could potentially have cost me $3500. Thank god they at least double checked after I left, but the ordeal was stressful and embarrassing. Professionalism is lacking and I felt very sketched out and uncomfortable with my experience today.",1,Indiana,ChIJM9T6O9OpbIgRH2OP2jnoxZE

This branch used to have very pleasant staff but they seem to have replaced them with very unprofessional people.

So if you need to do a wire please make an appointment because if they are busy they won’t do it for you.

Luckily a recorded phone call with one of their reps was recorded so they were able to see the account had existed at one time. FBI was involved and a class action suit is secretly in the works. Took almost a month to get every penny back but bank offered nothing while they basically held on to over $3000. Yeah crooks waited until a large bonus payroll check had been deposited before they started the scam. Even paid monthly fee for the fraud protection and this still happened. And just 2 weeks this branches atm didnt dispense $60 but stated pending on the account. They said the atm wasnt working correctly and had to wait til the transaction went through.

06/18/2016 15:51:20,Othello,"There's no good reason to bank here.

I just closed my account.
Reason?  To save money.  I'm now saving $8/month.
And most people lose $11 every month when they bank at Fifth Third.

I've been banking at 5/3rd (worst name for any company I've ever seen)
for 5 years--stupid of me to bank here when you lose money every month just for the privilege of being a member, I know.

I've been banking at Huntington for 3 years.
Huntington is free.  Why wouldn't it be?
Fifth Third costs you $11/month or $8/month if you're ""lucky.""

What do you get for $11/month?  A bank that closes at noon on Saturdays.  $37 overdraft fees, and fees on top of fees if the overdraft puts you negative.
On the other hand, Huntington gives you 24 hour grace.  If you see your account went negative, you have a full 24 hours to set it right.  Contrast that with 5/3rd.  The second your account is negative, it goes negative $37 more.  And 5/3rd bankers are richer for it.

Fifth Third's customer service is non-existent.  The tellers occasionally greet you.  There's one teller I've never seen smile.

In conclusion, banking at Fifth Third Bank, despite its catchy name (*sarcasm),
makes you poorer.",1,Indiana,ChIJi5wx8yZVa4gRyL6lTKtqgBo

09/23/2013 18:59:52,S. Wise,"Fifth/Third Bank is by far the WORST bank on the planet; the Shelby St Indianapolis Branch is a complete nightmare. The tellers in the branch are always rude and talk to my extremely intelligent mother, also a client there, like she's a child. They've run my credit for loans that I didn't ask for, and once I confronted them about it, rather than apologizing or even denying it, they give me tips to improve my credit; when mistakes are made the supervisor's number one concern is to protect the employees who made the mistake. My card expires at the end of this month- I called customer service at the beginning of the month to see when my card would come. The customer service rep was VERY kind and assured me it'd come within two weeks. Two weeks passed, so I went to the bank. The teller tried to tell me that the card I'd been using for the past few years had never been activated; then she refused to issue another because she didn't want there to be more than one coming to me. She told me to wait, and I did.

I just got off the phone with a very rude and unprofessional rep named Carina. Right off the bat she let me know with her tone of superiority that I was wasting her time. She asked a few security questions, and I muttered ""I believe"" to myself softly before I answered one and she became extremely rude ""YOU CAN'T SAY 'I BELIEVE' OR 'I THINK.' GIVE ME A DEFINITIVE ANSWER OR I WON'T GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT!"" She said this with a lot of heavy sighing, treating me like I was a complete inconvenience to her, acting like I had some audacity asking her to actually work while she's, you know, on her job.She was very nasty and said the card was sent back because *I* had a bad address (not true, it's a PO box that has received bank cards in the past) and assumed that the teller at the bank didn't issue me a card because I ""must not have had a valid ID"" (again, not true-- I'm not even sure how someone could even function without a valid ID). She actually chuckled and told me that I can request one from the bank, but it'll be another TWO WEEKS before I get a card, which means I have to go into February without a debit card.

Thanks a lot, Fifth-Third. It goes to show how much you truly care for your customers. You talk down to everyone who walks in the door, your customer service is awful, your tellers are incompetent, and employees take the liberty applying for loans for customers without consent.

I am taking my business elsewhere where they actually treat their clients with a little respect.",1,Indiana,ChIJGwlieqtba4gRY1ZUkMf_E4w
11/15/2017 18:09:20,Randy Joe Duke,"Long story, short. After not one but two of their tellers made the mistake of having me sign a money order that they then realized I couldn't use to pay my Father's taxes, which left me with a worthless piece of paper and short the $845 cash I had walked into the bank with. I asked to speak to a Manager. A lady who introduced herself as Tabitha came over. She hears my story and asks “So what do you want me to do about it?”. I ask her what could she do about it? She says I should take my stuff and leave. I let her know that this was a result of not just one but two of her tellers and if they shouldn’t have had me sign the money order. She talks to one of them named ""Thomas"", she then returns and once more tells me to take my stuff and leave and then just walks away. I followed and asked her “to please help because I had a very small window of time left to finish helping my Dad pay his taxes and now all his cash was gone thanks to their mistake. She told me to take my stuff and go or she’d call the Police. I took a good hard look at her and took notice that she was a very plain woman in her mid 20’s who not only had a weight issue but also had bad skin and a herpes cold sore on her lip yet what was most obvious, she was enjoying this. I realized she probably didn’t have much control over her own life, for example her obvious addiction to sweets, so she was silently reveling in this little abuse of power she did have. I knew there was no hope of me getting any help here. If you think that assessment sounds harsh I don’t believe I’m treating her any worse than she treated me. She never showed any effort of empathy or responsibility for the bad spot her bank and people put me and my Father in. Most importantly she immediately went on the defense and attacked instead of offering any kind of an apology. Mistakes happen, that I can understand and forgive but I won’t forgive this uncalled nastiness to cover up for inept people skills and poor service.Looking at some of the other reviews here I see I'm not the only one who has had issues with them.",1,Indiana,ChIJGwlieqtba4gRY1ZUkMf_E4w

Erica went back to her office and began working on her computer again. She still didn’t acknowledge me at all. A few moments later she told her associate, her computer had crashed and  the wire transfer she was working on was lost.
The teller reminded Erica that I was still waiting and she told her that she was still busy.  At no time did Erica every acknowledge me. Adam finally ask me if he could help me and he did.
I understand people are busy, but with the customer sitting in the lobby seeing Erica peeping from behind her desk to see who I was and not acknowledging me at all was pretty offensive.  I felt like I wasn’t worthy enough for her time.
Diana, the teller is always nice, but the manager may need to be retrained in customer service again.",1,Indiana,ChIJm0VW4c5Ka4gRE5sf0UO2JU8
11/11/2019 16:16:18,Anuhea Aquino,"Terrible! Had to come back a 2nd time to open up an account because there was only 1 teller and it took too long. When I finally got my account opened, the computer systems were down so I had to come in yet another time to sign paperwork.  When the business account got set up I decided to open up a personal checking with the promotional offer as a new customer. Brought in my offer code, was told it was applied. Checked after the 45 day period then inquired about it.... low and behold, no record of a promotional offer applied. What a total waste of time with this bank! Working on closing my accounts!

I’m a retired veteran and have taken some abuse before. This was the worst treatment I’ve received as a customer anywhere. If I could change to 0 stars, I would. New customers beware of this bank.

They lady told her she couldnt help her and to take the coin paper and count it yourself over by the seating area. Considering there were no customers at the time. Then there was another lady there. She could have helped her. I honestly like the bank but after this i think she will be going to another bank. Also because the lady told her to go to kroger and do it.

12/01/2018 15:20:35,James Dinkins,"I use this branch as it is nearest to where I  live. My wife and I bought my daughter here to open an account of her own ...  As I sit here waiting,
wondering what the banker and current customers' relative's high school affilations and past high school classmates' accomplishments have to do with the current business at hand I have the opportunity to write this review.  ... I understand banking with a personal touch, I understand building banking relationships...  However,  I also expect that a banker realize and respect the needs of waiting customers to ""not"" fill so much time with absolutely irrelevant conversation.
As I'm writing,  a gentleman who is waiting to be seen after me has simply gotten up and left.... I'm back to writing.  I had to take a  little 10 minute break to drop my wife off for an appointment..  I returned and my daughter is still waiting... As of now it's 10:11 am and it's been 50 minutes.  Just before the banker closed the door (at about the 15 minute mark) I overheard the banker make some comment about everyone being in such a hurry because it's the first of the month.... (Not sure what she was emplying with that but I do know that there are stigmas attached to the first of the month.)

Weightless is the feeling I get when I walk through those branch doors.  The two wonderful ladies behind the desk, both whom wear glasses are the best duo's I've ever seen do what they do and do it right.  Personally I've had some really amazing times going in to different 5/3 banks here in Indianapolis.  The one over on binford blvd  between 56th and allisonville road was really where I began my build towards trust for banks.  Then sadly I had to move away from them and started to come here since it was closer to home and work..and man, since Day 1 they welcomed me in, joked with me, talked to me as their self, shared some great information on how I can build credit, just did what natural genuine people do!  This bank makes me want to bring and buy them food and treats like that's how special they are!!  I can tell they've been there for years (which is a great sign because nowadays the turnovers are unreal), they all have great communication with each other, the branch manager talks to you without her title ever getting in the way.  I mean all out 5/3 has been great in selecting and training the best people because of the 2 locations Ive been at so far I once have not felt like just a number but rather respected and cared for as a person of my own identity.  Thank you 5/3 for truly sticking to your roots and remembering that we all are human, we all have a heart and soul, and not falling into the mediocrity of life but rather enriching lives not just your own.  I pass on my experience and hope the next one shares their great experience as well. KEEP IT UP",5,Indiana,ChIJTdaXtItLa4gRd-NSxDW_O8E

I got received my check and brought it to Fifth Third to deposit into my account and the clerk, Renee, was incredibly stand offish immediately. She just repeatedly told me that the check was ""not good"" and that she ""doesn't like the look of this.""  She ""called"" someone at the bank the check was coming from (Truest?) and told me that they verified that the check wasn't good. I took the check and went to the nearest Truest bank and got them to verify the check for me, and was told I could deposit it into Fifth Third, and if I had another issue to have Fifth Third contact them. I went back to Fifth Third and deposited the check. I woke up the next morning to find it on a 10 day hold (I was told by Renee that there would not be a hold) I wake up the next day and my account is being closed for fraudulent activity and I am $500K in the negative. I call Fifth Third and they were extremely unhelpful. I explained that I have legal documentation that proves the case is legitimist. I gave the contact information for the law firm that represented me. I explained that i went to the bank where the money is being issued from and THEY said it was all good. They told me i have 30 days to pay it all off. Fifth third told me to my face that the settlement i appeared in front of a judge for is a scam. They told me to my face that they know I am lying, even with all the evidence. They have now put me half a million dollars in debt because they refuse to admit to any fault on there part.

I went in to either refinance or borrow by personal loan, but the Manager kindly informed me that they will not give me a loan because my car is a year too old to refi and I don't have a checking account with them. He said that you must have a depository account with them for at least 90 days! (They have happily taken my checks from another local bank all along)  He also said that, ""Even though I had paid well, there is no type of exemption"".. that would allow them to alter their rigid lending policies....I was advised to contact my bank to see if they will loan me what I need...

Then, in 2018, the bank sent $405 (+3.89 fee) to a non-existent account in another bank. I immediately notified the bank, who said they would look into. Six months went by they kept putting the money back into my account, then removing it again, then putting it back into our account, and then removing it again. I went to the local branch twice. The first time after the bank closed the complaint because I didn't sign a one-page agreement that they failed to send me. The loan officer sent the signed paper (with me present) back to main branch. Another month passed. Finally, after contacting the FDIC, the problem was resolved. After hours of reviewing the account, another bank manager was able to solve the problem. The bank had put the money back into my account, except they put it in and took it away so many times that neither we nor the bank were able to track the money. Resolved? Not quite. The AGAIN put the money back into our saving account after the investigator closed the case. A week later, after the money had cleared (per the investigator's findings), the bank once again removed the money. Again, they didn't notify they were adding the money back into our account, they just did it. Ultimately (after the FDIC intervened), the money was removing from my savings account again, and I had to pay a penalty (AND they never returned the $3.89 fee!",1,Kentucky,ChIJCSH_nlkLQogRsDEDLpXtbdA

I am now $148 over drafted from these fees. I am on a fixed income. This amount is taking almost half of my paycheck. I will now be behind on my bills due to their errors. I have researched this and read many stories and lawsuits on how they take several days to take purchases out of your account, so then when they clear, on THEIR end your account is in the negative (supposedly) so they take overdraft fees. Although it doesn’t show this way on our end. It’s their way of scamming us. I’m extremely cautious of my account and manage my money very well. Their overdraft fees are $37 per charge and $25 every week your account is over drafted. This is ROBBING people. No credit Union or bank I have ever went through has ever charged this much.

01/02/2018 15:50:16,Sandy G,"You wrote a review for Fifth Third Bank	14 minutes ago
1.0 star rating 1/2/2018
I deposited a large check for more than $10,000 in the bank on Friday, 12/29/17.  I asked when the funds were available to transfer and the teller stated Monday or Tuesday. The funds were available yesterday.

Today, Tuesday, 1/2/18, I tried to move the funds to another non-fifth third account.  The bank doesn't allow you to transfer more than $2,000 per day and $5,000 per month.  Fifth Third Bank charges a $3.00 fee for each transfer.

I called the branch to see if there was any other option.  The teller, Cindy, said that transfer limits were set by the Federal Reserve Bank which isn't true.  The teller Cindy said there was no other option.  I then asked to get a check and close my account and she said I had to wait 5-7 days for the funds to be released by the other party.  I asked why since the funds are available she said that was the rule.  I then called the Banking Center Manager Raymond at the Burlington Pike location.  He said I can pick the check up at any time since the funds are available.

I should have gone to Chase bank where the staff are informed and actually provide the appropriate information.

I am closing my account with Fifth Third Bank and have no desire to be a customer where I am treated so poorly.  It is not the first time this location have misinformed but it is now the last time.",1,Kentucky,ChIJ59OJhuHFQYgRWZpledHAbSg

I told her she was wrong and she started arguing with me and was extremely rude. I said to give me back my pesos and I'll go to another branch. So I went to a fifth third in Lexington and they calculated it correctly. Then I got my 200 USD.,1,Kentucky,ChIJZzF-o4z9QogR_h907RqsOSc

I am an honest person and knew the money wasn't mine. I finally got a hold of a person over the phone after almost an hour of trying. They said the problem would be fixed. It wasn't. I then had to go to a local branch and spent another hour of my time getting it fixed. We will be leaving after our refinance goes through.

So the saga continues now 5/3 finally took out the second 900 but as of this morning they took out the first 900. This caused my account to be overdraft and I was charged 75 dollars. Complaints have been filed. And my accounts will be closed. Good bye and good riddens.",1,Kentucky,ChIJZzF-o4z9QogR_h907RqsOSc

He has his national guard money direct deposited in this account which I never had a problem transferring for him, well now all of a sudden he can't touch that money either even though it's money he's earned and not part of the original account balance.

When he finally went over there, they were standing around talking instead of answering phones. Then they promised him it would be taken care of that day, but it took 3 more days for anything to happen. Then they took TWICE the amount out and gave us an overdraft charge! Then surprise, when I tried to call the branch again, there was no answer. I had to spend an hour on the phone with headquarters.

Feel discriminated against yet, those of you whom are poor or have low income and are trying to get affordable houses? I would.

08/05/2017 05:58:36,Rick Lucas,I visited this bank and was astounding by the level of bravado. I had a simple transaction. A $20 check to be cashed drawn on Fifth Third. I was told that since I did not have an account there it would be $4 to cash a $20 check. $4? 20%? That seems like extortion. $4 fee to cash a $20 check drawn on your bank is greed. Plain and simple. To refuse to cash a check drawn on that bank is a failure of your fiduciary responsibility. Greed. The reason I am writing this review is because when I snorted derision about the highway robbery of charging $4 to cash a $20 check she slapped the check back down on the counter like I was out of line. I walked out and deposited the check into my bank. I would think it is going to cost them to make that transaction. I am stunned by the audacity and greed of banks. They have no shame. I would not do business with Fifth Third and especially that branch. Bad company with bad policies that employ bad employees.,1,Kentucky,ChIJSdUhurQOaYgRAqC7UNEvzB4

01/16/2023 21:00:16,joe moore,Your credit has to be at least very good or good with significant reliable income to get credit here. Their customer service is excellent but it will pay to know the rules on checking and credit cards. The only real knock on them is that they appear to have went back to sequencing check debits from greatest amount to least in order to maximize their overdraft fees. This was supposed to have been banned by the 2009 banking legislation after the mortgage bubble burst. It may only appear that they're back to that practice but it's worth making sure.,4,Kentucky,ChIJMSfndSR0RogRedc-LN58zAE

I used them for my business when I first opened. They told me that they had a payroll company for businesses and to give them a try. I lost over 5k dollars to this payroll company because an employee put the wrong dates in the system. 5/3 did absolutely nothing to get that money back for me. I took my personal laptop to the bank and proved to them that it wasn’t on my end. The lady at the payroll company even said it was on their end. I’ve never seen that money back. I also had a personal account with them. I had several charges come out and yet again, the bank did nothing to correct the issue. The guy that does the credit card machines is another waste of time. Very poor customer service and a terrible bank all the way around. I had a $200.00 charge against my personal account for an address change that they’ve never corrected.

11/18/2022 13:13:39,Jacqueline Ortiz,"Is a fraud they offers to  give you 250.00 if you open an account and deposit 1,000 in the first 90 days. I did it and they never gave me the bonus. Second, customer service is the worst. They blocked my ATM and when I went to the branch in Florence, KY told me that I had to wait 5 days for another one to arrive by mail even though I told them that I needed an emergency one since I was going on a trip. Third, someone committed fraud with my account where they stole 700.00 from my account. They made me the temporary refund required by the federal laws governing the banks, then the bank took back the $700.00 from my account claiming that they could not recover the money of the person who scammed me even though it was for zelle. So I can use the bank to do fraud and they don't do anything. Customers lose money and the bank does not comply with the law of reporting these frauds. I never recommend this bank to anyone. Don't make that mistake if you want to have your money safe. Don't do it. The other banks are better.",1,Kentucky,ChIJIe3_zDfHQYgR7KhQk3ddK2g

The lady who was helping me wasn't much of help, didn't bother to explain the fees, etc.  Also told that there would be another fee if I were to close the account and take cash instead of check.

I called this branch and the representative told me he couldn’t close my account over the phone and I had to come into the branch. If this were true I wouldn’t be upset however he was rude and  I knew that couldn’t be true because I opened the savings account over the phone. He wasn’t being truthful. I called the 53rd 800 number and a rep closed my account in less then 2 minutes.  I’ve been a loyal customer for 16 yrs and I’m considering taking my business elsewhere after this experience.

Ok, one problem: I want to add my husband to my account & also open a couple of CD accounts. However the branch I go to can't do that on a Saturday, the one day of the week I can get my husband there (and yes he has to be there in person, can't just sign a form).

Teller wouldn’t even take the number to help deposit my check(In Ohio the teller would have done it but I was on my lunch break and it was busy). She told me that I have to do that when the insurance company told me to give it to you, and the guy standing next to her was no help either(Assuming he was some sort of manager). Then she told me to cash the check it would cost me $31 dollars??? At the bank I just opened an account at and was about to deposit over $1500??? Glad to know as a new customer I’m not valued.

At first I loved coming here because of the awesome helpful lady who had her own room off to the side but she's not really there anymore. An Indian man by the name of Krishan Sehgal works there mainly now by himself and he's very rude. I went there last month with a couple checks and he said the bank didn't have enough money to cash my checks. This time around he said he couldn't cash them because I didn't have a matching amount in my account and limited me to how much I could cash. Paying me only in $20 bills stating he had no $50 in the entire bank and was going to charge me a fee even tho I had MORE then what he allowed me to cash in my account. (Which he verbally told other customers how much I wanted to cash which is unsafe and unprofessional.) He stated that the banks have always done that and I said it was a first time for me. Then he went off but I couldn't really understand him because of his strong accent. He had the happiest sarcastic smile on his face at the end of his rant and I just smiled and thanked him and walked out with no avail. He then did tell me to have a good day tho as I was leaving 😂 ... low character moral at this place!  I will not be coming back to this location again...,1,Michigan,ChIJL04XTKJYI4gRAR8gd7L-YRc

This bank may or may not give me my $174 back in 8-10 business days! Folks do not bank here. The policies are antiquated and the customer service is the worst I’ve seen in 50 years! How dare someone in this day and age take weeks to refund stolen money- that’s exactly what this is- it’s theft and fraud. I have retained an attorney and will proceed with filing claim against this bank and we are moving banks!

05/01/2023 21:16:30,Adventure Time,"I opened a new account with fifth third bank. I used my overdraft protection to get gas in my car when I had an emergency.  Approx one week later I made a mobile deposit with my paycheck from my employer, which is the STATE GOVERNMENT.
I found out the next day that a hold was put on my paycheck. I called the local branch, I called customer service, I called the fraud department. Each phone call resulted in a different explanation for why the hold was placed on my check.  Customer service told me that the funds won’t be available until May 8th.  I made this deposit April 27th.  They told me the federal government put a hold on the check. The local branch said they didn’t know why the hold was placed. They said I need to call someone else. I tried the fraud department who told me it was flagged for possible insufficient funds from the account who issued the check. Fraud dept told me I need to deal with the local branch to have the hood removed sooner.  Fraud dept states that the branch Manager or the branch RAM has the ability to remove my check hold.  When I call my local branch now I am still not met with any helpful information. Lynn is the branch manager who told me she contacted the RAM and also “put in a ticket” to get this resolved. I could not get a time frame expectation for a response.  I have still not gotten a logical explanation as to why my funds can not be released to me from my STATE employer. I also asked Brianna Sharpe, who says she is my personal banker at the local branch level, to give me the phone number for the district manager. She gave me a non-working phone number.
This is a nightmare and all I want is my paycheck that I worked hard for.

08/06/2022 21:30:33,Christopher Rich,My account was being used online by someone else. So I reported it to the bank and wanted a new card replacement. I was told they will credit my account and send a new card within 8 business days and credit my account within 8 business days. They don’t offer temporary cards so I had a prepaid debt card from the bank so the system shows that the account is active but the card is not anymore. I asked the lady at the counter if I add funds will I be able to still use the card she looked at it and said yes. So I switched money from checking account to the card and went to use it to find out it kept declining it. So I called the back of the card phone number the guy said it was not active anymore and theirs nothing he could do about it. So I asked for a supervisor and he said under fifth third rules they’re allowed to transfer you to a supervisor and it would take 24 to 48 hours to do anything with a supervisor. Worse bank ever 8 working days to get funds back and a new debt card and can’t talk to a supervisor until they call you back in 24 to 48 hours. They claim making it easier is fifth third but everything I hear is they don’t care about their account holders and doesn’t make anything easier on the customer. Imagine you were out of state and someone stolen your wallet or purse they would have you stuck without any funds and if someone drains your account you would have to wait 8 working days to get anything from them. As soon as possible I will be switching my accounts to a different financial institution. They keep telling me it’s policy and they can’t do anything else about it. Policy needs to change or the are going to be like bofa losing lots of customers and having to shut down branches,1,Michigan,ChIJlaAJPMI5O4gRkw2QhM4FuGw

We have been transferred to more than seven different customer service agents in 3 or more departments.  Each time we were given different requests of documents to be sent in, different timelines and felt they do not know what they are talking about or how to help.  The customer service agents are really good at hanging up when they don't want to deal with the call any longer or the issues are difficult.  They are very rude and disrespectful and I am flabbergasted how these individuals have or keep a job that requires understanding and empathy! We have asked for the address to the office of the President so he will know the names of these truly rude  employees and how they represent his company over all. I am sure he will be shocked and appalled at their actions.  I am currently waiting for a manager of the retention department to give us a call back, however not holding my breath. I am absolutely disturbed at how this has been handled and how I have been spoken to.

She laughed in my face and told me I had to go to a branch that was permanently closed when I told her an atm took my money. We asked another teller and at a different branch about the atm taking my money, she gave me a dispute number to call, which this white haired lady could have easily done in the first place.

I  had already paid for the trip, she was reimbursing me.  I tried to deposit it at my bank. My bank said there’s something wrong with the micr encoding on this and it said this was issued in Kentucky their corporate offices in Ohio, so it looks suspicious. Take it over to another fifth third branch and see if they can figure out the  micr encoding to know how to draft this to draw it against the branch where this was issued  in Palm Harbor Florida. I then drove to a fifth branch where I live and was told they can’t wait on me because I am not a customer. They can only serve their customers I said well where does that leave me then with this instrument that was issued to me and they said you need to return it to your friend and have her issue another form of payment  and we suggest you send it certified mail in case it gets lost because it was a money order. I did as I was instructed my friend received it. She signed for it. She took it today to her fifth third branch in Palm Harbor where she is a customer and they told her that they had to wait for it to the voiding of that instrument to be approved and it could take two or three business days  no apologies and they told her that they were going to charge her $10 to draft a cashiers check to issue to me for the payment. I had spoken to the branch manager and said this is ridiculous. How can you charge a customer when it was your branches fault she said I am not allowed to waive any fees at all , I said then I need to talk to your manager she said you can try but I don’t think it’ll do you any good!

01/08/2024 23:25:31,Joan Ramos,"Dividend now a Division of Fifth Third Bank.
made advanced payments to the contractor (Vision Solar) before work was complete. They forged signatures, used fake email addresses, also was on the phone with the VS salesperson during the sales pitch making tax incentive promises and insisting that I be on the loan versus my husband who makes more money, has better credit and less debt! Asking consumers to ""sign"" to get preapproved and to confirm their property is indeed qualified for solar panels when IN FACT consumers were signing a LOAN CONTRACT!! I did not even see a loan contract until it was emailed to me TWO MONTHS later after signing up for panels.

They still have not provided me with requested documents.
Dividend has also placed a lien on my home without notifying me, which I discovered on my own via my county clerk website.

They are in violation of the Florida lien law by not providing me with a copy.

when filing a UCC Financing Statement that has been recorded, a copy must be sent via registered mail (return-receipt requested) to properly notify the owner. Apparently, these steps were not followed. But that is not surprising given the way Dividend has handled everything so far.

When I discovered the lien, I also discovered a notarized document from January 19th, 2023, with my signature forged on there.
I never signed nor was in the presence of the named Notary ever.
Forgery on notarized documents is a Third degree felony.

Florida law prohibits a notary from notarizing any signature if the signer is not present at the time of the notarization.
Hundreds of consumers are now stuck with non-working panels that were never activated and installed illegally without permits or inspections and homeowners facing fines because of this illegal install.

Dividend approved documents,receipts, and photos from Vision Solar when work was INCOMPLETE!!

Dividend hired third-party contractors to fix what Vision Solar did not.

The third-party contractors, Florida power management, have informed me in writing that they are not authorized by Dividend to replace or repair anything. only to get up and running what Vision Solar left behind.

Numerous Vision Solar employees have come forward to say the panels, inverters, and brackets etc are defective. So what's the point of hiring a third-party solar contractor if you're not allowing them to make repairs. The panels caused structural damage to my roof that was new before panels were installed.

My requests, complaints and emails to both Dividend and Fifth Third Bank continue to go unanswered.",1,New Mexico,ChIJh5DChVCxQYgRoivxyJi5a3I

It's not this specific location either, but Fifth Third in its entirety. I work overseas, and they have blocked my card numerous times for ""fradulent"" or ""suspicious activity"" when I have told them in advance that I would be working abroad. And each time I talk to their customer service reps, I have told them that I am abroad from the U.S. And each time they act surprised like they didn't already have that information on hand. They are completely unprofessional and aloof. Plus, they have shadow blocked my account for any activity they see suspicious, meaning I can't login into my account online and even verify my info because the system acts like I don't have an account with them to begin with. They don't notify you either with a text, phone call or email when this happens. So as you can imagine, I'm in a foreign country with no way to pay for my basic needs because Fifth Third decided to block me on their own decision for no apparent reason. And there is no way to unblock my card or verify that it's me because they do not send you a notification for a purchase verification like other banks. I have to call them to unblock my account, but the catch is is that their international customer support is based in the U.S and is not 24/7. So if you're abroad in a different time zone when most people in the U.S are asleep and need your card unblocked, you are SOL.

2.  The bank established account(s) for my Dad and would not disclose the existence of the account(s) to the estate executor.

3.  The bank refused to redeem certificates of deposit for my Mom.  They said the accounts are being reviewed by the legal department but they refused to give any names or phone numbers I could call.

4.  My Dad established accounts with Fifth Third Bank decades ago when he did not have a trust.  After forming a trust he retitled the accounts into the name of the trust.  The accounts were shown on monthly statements as being in the trust.  When my Dad died the bank decided that the accounts were not part of the trust because they forget to have my Dad sign new signature cards with ""Trustee"" after his name.  The bank operated my Dad's accounts illegally for years without proper signature cards, and it was the bank's fault.

Fifth Third Bank.  The only bank you will NEVER need.

I called the customer service number and they said an investigation had been opened by the Office of the President.  Do you think they ever called me? No.

My Mom is 93 years old and has given me power of attorney to help her.  I have been trying to close her accounts for weeks but the bank refuses to honor her accounts.  What kind of bank would deny a 93 year old her money?  You guessed it.  Fifth Third Bank.  It is the Hotel California of banking.  You can put your money in but you can never get it out.

Terrible, terrible service - I'm out.

12/08/2018 17:11:47,Mr K,"CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT MATERIAL

I received a phone call several weeks ago from my insurance broker regarding my home owners policy.  I was told the insurance premium was not paid by my mortgage bank “FIFTH THIRD BANK” and there was a notice to cancel my policy.  It was then that the nightmare began.  My broker tried to reach FIFTH THIRD BANK but was unsuccessful.

I personally called FIFTH THIRD and was told “they” could not help and my only recourse was to call their processor who handled insurance payments.  I was provided with a phone number and email address.
I sent two emails over a period of several days, both came back “rejected”.  I called the phone number provided and each time was placed in a phone queue for over an hour until I had to end the calls.  I called FIFTH THIRD again and explained how my calls to “their” processor were not answered.  This time I was told their processor was having problems with their phone and I was instructed to wait and call back.  Over the next several days I continued to call “their” processor and each time NO ONE answered my calls.  Also, while I was on hold, a message would periodically state: “if you press one, you will not lose your place and will receive a return phone call”.  Each time I called and pressed one, another recording would state: “that function is not working”.

After numerous attempts to reach FIFTH THIRD’s processor, I called FIFTH THIRD and asked to speak to Teresa Tanner, the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.  My request was ignored and my call was given to a bank manager.  I was then given the same song and dance, i.e. we can’t help you.  You must call the “NON WORKING” phone number and/or send an email to the “NON WORKING” email address provided.

At one point I received another call from my insurance broker, who said that after calling the number FIFTH THIRD provided, and placing the call on a speaker phone for over an hour, someone finally picked up the call.  My broker was told a check would be sent overnight for receipt on Wednesday morning December 5th.   On the evening of December 5th, my insurance broker called me to explain that the check was not received and how they had again called FIFTH THIRD’s processor, and after another hour, someone picked up and explained that the check did not go out and ""they did not know why"".

Well, the excuses FIFTH THIRD bank was throwing out, during various phone conversations, were either:
1)	They changed the mailing address where insurance companies should mail their premium bills but failed to notify the insurance companies of the address change.
OR
2)	FIFTH THIRD transitioned to a new insurance premium bill processor but thousands of their customers were not transitioned from the old provider to the new.

Well today I received three calls from Fifth Third bank, one at 8:30 a.m., stating that they were calling to give me a status update.  The update was: they didn’t know when the premium would be paid.  Later on in the day, I received a call again, this time stating how the payment was scheduled to be received tomorrow by overnight mail.  About an hour later, I received another call from FIFTH THIRD’s employee, whose job it is to follow up on the responses received from customer ‘s surveys.   He told me how he saw that the payment was scheduled to be mailed overnight for receipt tomorrow.  But he added, that he couldn’t guarantee that it would actually happen due to prior failed promises.  He ended the call by saying: “GOOD LUCK!”.

I hope that enough of FIFTH THIRD’s customers get fed up with the banks’ negligent and irresponsible actions and reach out and file complaints with the Bank’s regulatory agencies and/or gather’s together for a class-action lawsuit for gross negligence.

So to FIFTH THIRD BANK I say: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!",1,New Mexico,ChIJh5DChVCxQYgRoivxyJi5a3I

I called fifth third service center and spoke to a supervisor named Jenna on 9-12-15. She told me I have to get my money from the tax dept.

Upon reading and understanding the protocols of the transaction, the logic in providing clarity was not provided respectfully and patiently. The customer service from the toll free line was totally unacceptable due to the language barrier , thick accents and lack of respect from the customer service reps. To get more clarity on my situation, I called my local branch in hopes of compassion, respect and patience....only to interact with a customer rep who started raising her voice ,loosing her patience and being condescending with me in my efforts of trying to understand the protocols of my issue.  I work in healthcare,  and in a very busy emergent setting and one thing that you have to have with dealing with sick individuals are patience, empathy and understanding as well as customer service. Even though this is a bank and not a hospital, customer service  and care is the pinnacle of a positive outcome for any situation when interacting with the public.  Customer care, patience and understanding was NOT what I experienced today.  My business will be terminated and moved to another institution.",1,North Carolina,ChIJH8I_HyUcVIgRMWv4ZWOu3G4

There was not a single customer in the bank but the banker wasn't interested in talking to us so he won’t interrupt what sounded like a personal call he was conducting and ask us to come back later , VERY unrespectful very unprofessional.

02/07/2022 18:15:32,Rakesh Nara,"Been customer at this bank from 2021, so far the experience was good.

Pros:
1. 5/3 offers pay check to come before 2 days into your account.
2. Has ATM at this location.
3. They offer safe deposit boxes.
4. For new account opening they will give $300 as promotion or so when you deposit 500+ in first 60 days or so. But this you need to check with banker at that time.
5. At very convenient location.
6. Offers free notary for members, worked with Angela she is great lady and very flexible on calendar.
7. Drive thru services

Cons:
1. For deposits inside bank lines are pretty long as most of the times there will be only one person working.

If you are planning to visit for deposit the money or check , better use ATM or mobile check deposit from app.",4,North Carolina,ChIJH8I_HyUcVIgRMWv4ZWOu3G4

I was wearing a Kobe Bryant shirt and mask and she made a super insensitive remark about how fans have their mouths on Kobe’s Jock…only saying jock after she caught herself. I couldn’t believe and instead of cursing her out I left out the bank in which a co worker of hers followed and apologized on her behalf.

I rushed to the bank once I got off work to ask questions and to change a few things on my account. I sat and waited for the personal banker for 30 minutes while he laughed and had a personal conversation with a customer. While we waited another female walked in and also had to wait. Once it was five minutes to close, he finally came out and stated to the young lady that was waiting, “I already know your concern I will be with you in a second.” Then he turns to me and my husband and states, “What do you need and what questions do you have concerning your account.” I explained to him, if I wanted the entire bank to know my personal information I would have went to the teller.  Who by the way couldn’t assist me with my concerns. He then stretch his hands out and looked around as if he didn’t care and to show it wasn’t that many people in the bank. Then he tap his watch and basically explain that they were about to close.  He then proceeded to ask the female banker who was there the entire time and never once came out to assist, if she could help us. She basically had a look on her face as to say, it’s about to close and not really. So we proceeded to get up and leave. No apologies, no can we make an appointment, nothing....

Four times to move my money from my primary business checking to my secondary business checking at the desk. Then I was advised by management that it’s up to tellers discretion whether or not the fees will be assessed. Hows that for discrimination!The staff is so condescending and unprofessional- the manager addressed me as hun or dear as if I don’t deserve the proper salutation. I run a business- I employ staff- the manager is well aware of such. Because I had the audacity to constantly question the fraudulent fees that kept appearing on my account the manager sends me a letter in which I received on 2.16(Friday evening) advising me that my business account will be closed on 2.22. No deposits will be honored- therefore I have employees that will be inconvenienced. My suggestion-stay far away from this bank. Watch the service fees and misc fees they are imposing. Because these people are very sheisty. I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau and emailing anyone of importance so that they are aware of what I and my business went through in less than six months.

My payroll went into the bank Wednesday because of the 2 day early thing. Than 5th 3rd froze my account for fraud. I work in banking for over 10 years in my AML department so I know how these things go, so I talked to their fraud department. They said I either need 2 photo ID'S which the patriot act states since I'm a u.s citizen and not a non resident or resident alien.. I only need a u.s drivers license and a debit card. Or 5th third wanted a photo ID, a bill and my social security card. Well..being 27 I did not have my social security card on me but I had my tax returns printed which has my social security number on it. I printed out my duke bill and had a valid ID while I'm in front of a banker while she's on the phone with fraud department. I am who I say I am. But wait there's more. It wasn't enough to release my direct deposit. They said they could send a text message to me to verify me. But my phone number was too new so I wasn't in a phone verification system. I told them I have an old number that I could try to access, they said that number would be fine because it's in their system. But At&T already shut that line off...I had to pay at&t 133$ to turn that phone back on just to receive a text from 5th 3rds fraud department just so they can release the hold off my account so I can pay rent! Because if not I was going to have to order a social security card and have it mailed to me. I was going to contact some law firms because I'm in AML, and what you guys put me through i would of ran you through the ringer.

Their robo-caller called me numerous times.  It thought my name was ""We're sorry, the system is down right now, please try again later."" Their system lost my transfer but somehow still applied the curtailment to it.  Just to make sure I wasn't crazy, I tried doing this on purpose, but it doesn't permit it.  I called the customer service line at 9:00am, but it told me they're closed until 8:00am that same day!  I double-checked the time zones.  I tried reaching out by online messaging, but they ignored my message and just told me my balance.  When I asked if they even read my message, they didn't address anything in it, they just said yes.

Worked with me on doing it a certain way so I would be able to finish what I had to do........ This location tried calling other stores for help. Every option, question, or inquiry was followed up immediately with No, hmmm, sorry, I just hmmm...... I’ve never been more frustrated. Not to mention it took 30 minutes for no help.

First off is the service and employees. It feels as everyone want to assure you all questions and needs are met to satisfaction. Our favorite teller is Valentina (I will correct the spelling), she's always there to brighten your day, even if your visit is for a menial task.

The banking itself on location, at this bank is always wonderful, quick and smooth. As for Fifth Third's overall system... I would say is customer friendly, even as issues may occur. It is important to mention that I look for how a bank strives to tend to their clients' needs, and that's where this bank excels, as per my experience.

I was mean mugged by the branch manager for getting there at 4:55... but a deposit shouldn't take a full 5 minutes so why the attitude???

Then to top it off, the employee moved so slow (probably frazzled after the manager was rude to her in front of people) that I couldn't even make my deposit without my ride threatening to leave!

Ever since I've opened this account, I've had nothing but issue after issue after issue. This entire institution as a whole is terrible and this branch definitely follows suit.

This is the ONLY BANK THAT HAS EVER HELD MY CHECKS FOR 2 WEEKS.. and the checks have all been from my employer!!!!

The drive-thru often has a wait of 10-15 minutes.  You know that's why we're at the drive-thru, right?  Because we're in a hurry.

The manager Harold Barr is the WORST.  Thinks very highly of himself with his flashy jewelry and 3-piece suits, has a terrible attitude.  He thinks the customers are there to serve him, and not the other way around.  He discriminated against me about a loan, and I've heard the same from others.  He has NO interest in serving small business owners and his smugness is disgusting.  Fifth Third management should fire him immediately.

Other employees are useless, rude, and just don't care.  I've been banking here for years, just out of location convenience, and it just goes from bad to worse and never gets any better.  You'd think that Fifth Third management would actually read these stinking reviews and train a manager on proper customer service, but no.",1,North Carolina,ChIJt69IHKsdVIgRswBJ_bn4fvo

I walked in and she didn’t greet me. I stood at the counter for almost 3 mins before she acknowledged me. I told her I needed an ATM card. She looked into Judy Parker’s office from the counter and she told me that it would be an hour before someone would be able to help me. She told me that she could make me an appointment. I told her why would I need an appointment when there’s only one person in the bank besides me. There was literally only one customer in the bank and he was in Ms. Parker’s office. Mrs.Parker had her door wide open laughing and talking to the customer asking him personal questions that had nothing to do with banking. The teller Valentina seems to be very  intimidated by Judy.

I explained she could process the payment with my social security number.

She processed the payment.  I asked  her name because she refused to help me.  She should have asked me for my social security number without me telling her.  I explained this to her and she disconnected the screen at the drive through.  She lied by saying she did not refuse.  She told me she cold not take the payment and that is refusing.  She rely dryly talked over me as I instructor her to process the payment with my information.

No reason for Karen to be rude and gain pleasure in making wait to express a verbal complaint.  Anna had me wait now 15 minutes.  Finally Aldolphus Brown came 15 minutes later.

11/08/2022 15:09:23,Robby Birdsong (birdblue4u2),"It's been a long time since I've had to open a bank account. It was probably the easiest thing I've ever done here at 5th3rd bank. I expected it to be very difficult, but surprisingly it wasn't. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come. You know easy pleasant banking.
This is an update. A few months ago when I open this account I reviewed the bank and gave them five stars. I'm now changing that to one star. I've not yet moved my account and I am so glad I did not. I've been at Bank of America for many years. My wife has been at her bank for more years than I was at Bank of America. We open this account because we wanted to start trying to bank jointly meaning we would have moved both of our accounts here eventually. But oh my God I'm glad I didn't. So I accidentally swiped this new debit card by accident. Which overdrafted the account by a few dollars so I went in and did a transfer on the same day from my attached Bank of America account. Thinking this would be efficient but no the transfer took many days to go through and they proceeded to charge me a $37.50 overdraft. I reached out several times to the bank using the message system thinking that they would resolve this. Not only have they not because they've asked me the most generic questions. They should have had the answers to already. They proceeded to charge me another $25 so at this point a few dollars has cost around $62.50. now Bank of America will only charge me $10 for an overdraft. This company or this bank seems to be charging $60 for overdrafts. This is unacceptable and now I see why they're paying people to open accounts here. This must change if they want me to move my banking here.
This will be my third update. I changed my review back to five Stars because Julia or Julie at my local branch corrected the problem. But for now, I think I'll leave the description for everything in the review for new customers in case they're having the same issue.",5,North Carolina,ChIJj9x4ns7prIkRrd6ePh-pCyk

He confirmed it was there and said, “Sounds good.” Drove all the way to the bank to be told they didn’t have it. Plus, the manager had left for the day. When the employee called his cell to confirm the conversation that I had just had with him barely an hour ago, he literally said, “Oh yeah, I told him we didn’t have it.” Strongly considering switching banks.

01/24/2020 15:23:14,K N.,"This complaint is against Kristen Cuccia (KC) negligent and unprofessional for open a promotion checking account at 5/3 bank.

My wife and I opened accounts at 5/3 bank (1818 Matthews PKWY, Matthews, NC 28105) on 9/20/19 for the promotion bonus offers. Both accounts were handled by KC. She opened accounts for me without any issues. But when she open accounts for my wife, KC was in a hurry and wanted to leave early on that Friday around 3pm. The most important was she negligently didn’t go through the promotion requirements details with us such as minimum deposits, etc. That caused my wife account didn’t qualified for the promotion bonus.

My promotion required minimum deposit of $250 and I deposited $300 to open a new checking and $25000 to open a new money market account and I ended up receive a promotion bonus.

Since we believed both promotion offers were similar, but KC didn’t go through the promotion details with us; so we expected both offers’ requirements were the same as my offer, so I deposited the same $300 for my wife a new checking and $25000 for open a new money market account. So total deposited $25300 on 5/3 bank on the same day for new accounts under my wife name. Unfortunately, my wife offer was required $500 deposit instead of $250 as my offer (found out later on 12/20/19)! But KC had never mentioned, reminded, nor advised us about that amount when we were opening those accounts!

We would like 5/3 bank to honor the promotion offer bonus of $500 to my wife since that was 5/3 employee Kristen Cuccia negligently did not go through the requirements with us nor remind us what was the minimum deposit requirement.  We were the new customers bring the promotion offers to that branch and expected receive the best advise from the banker in order to receive the bonus. Unfortunately, we didn’t receive the service we expected from KC; especially, KC was not an inexperience banker, in fact, she was a branch manager of that location!

We were disappointed since we found out my wife didn’t receive that bonus on 12/20/19, we wish KC should have let another well experienced banker to take care of us since she wanted to leave in a hurry on that Friday! We had learned do not trust any bankers from now on as they may not looking after for the customer best interest! We are evaluating being continue be customers of 5/3 bank!

Since KC was a branch manage with such negligent and unprofessional toward customers, I’m question other tellers under her management would getting better? No wonder the Matthews branch review is SO LOW as 1.8 stars out of 5 under her management!",1,North Carolina,ChIJXfy5r_cjVIgRP_4crI7lb2A

Yesterday -(4/17/2020)  I went to the drive thru hoping to get a replacement card for my Prepaid 360 Account. The woman - I think her name is Alice is always lost, confused, and unprofessional to me. I mentioned to her that it was a block on my account and I needed a temporary card. She stated, ""There is no block on your account"" and I was never issued a card. Her and another banker talked and laughed about my situation right in my face. Very unprofessional and I hate this place!

I always have a wonderful experience at the Garner Location. I went today 4/17/2020 and was issued a temporary card with no questions asked😊! I think the bankers at the six forks location need to be retrained or look for another job because their customer service is awful.

I spoke to the branch manager 4/17/2020 but I didn't feel like she fully understood my complaints and concerns because she was discussing things on my account that had nothing to do with the temporary card. Are you looking to help me or spy through my account?

Again, this place really sucks and I won't go unless its my last option.

06/24/2021 15:51:24,Brandon Horton,"Avoid 5/3 bank.  I tried getting payment deferments during COVID, they botched the process on their end and a payment didn't happen for a month.  I ""resolved"" the issue but 5 months later they retroactively applied a late fee for each month because that payment was missed.
They refused to do anything whatsever about the late fees.  Went into the branch and discussed how odd that was, I got agreement and a promise to handle it.. and a call to me the next day.  This was very clear.
I left, never got a call, my call to the branch to follow up was on 20 minute hold before disconnecting.  I was told, ""too bad, pay up.""
Very awkward series of events.  Their web page never showed a late payment, nothing was ever ""wrong"" until it was.  I don't trust anything about this bank.

Update 2 weeks later:  I called Fifth Third to confirm a check had cleared to payoff a motorcycle for a sale.  I've had 3 different answers about how they're going to handle payoff.  I went into a branch, they deposited a check and apparently the deposit was incorrectly done.. but my account shows $0 owed.  It takes them 10 biz days to detect or correct their errors.
They claim they have 0 responsibility for any incorrect data on their web page, given by reps, or otherwise available to you.
It takes 3-4 weeks to get a title in the mail after payoff.. they will not pre-ship the title to the branch for an easy transfer of ownership.
5/3 is a minimum viable product of a bank.  Avoid or it will cost you.

BTW:  Called the number in the response.. it's their social media group.. no actual power or effort to resolve issues.",1,North Carolina,ChIJyekU0mNYrIkRJYt7tE6O4MY

These ppl messed up my money and their system is outdated it took an entire week to process my bank to this bank and it ended up bouncing back. Then the teller Codi is A BIG LIAR I asked why I wasn't alerted when my account was on negative he lied and said that I could set it up, so I got on the app to set it up and there is no where to set up any alerts.

With the opening of the Eastway Dr. branch, I now bank at this location, which is in my neighborhood. On 2 recent occasions my experience was most positive. This is a much smaller location than most, but the service is not 'small'. In fact, on recent occasions, those that helped me went above and beyond. Not only were they friendly, professional and knowledgeable. They provided a follow up call with additional information to assist me with my issue.  With the shortage of help due to covid and other reasons, across many industries, I was pleasantly surprised and very appreciative of the assistance and service I received.",5,North Carolina,ChIJeU6-gnIhVIgRHg2Bxf9dyGM

09/23/2022 18:32:20,Chris Scarborough,"Absolutely the worst bank to deal with! The people at the branch seem genuine and honestly want to help, but ""procedures"" keep them tied down. There is Absolutely no good reason to place holds on thousands of dollars from legitimate local businesses, because of a clerical error not on my part. We've been customers for several years, but that will no longer be the case! I've never been more upset with a financial institution who wanted me to provide personal identification data from another much more prominent investment company, before they would release ""hold"" on my account. So if they would be willing to accept information with blatant fraud possibility written all over it, what else will they do with your money? Disgusting how they are willing to do business, and a shame for the lovely people who had attempted to help me there at the branch.",1,North Carolina,ChIJKUFSFOD_U4gRtkLSfpAYjqc

02/11/2020 15:43:45,Jeffrey Burris,This branch is a disaster. Please see the reviews below and you will see I’m not alone in my thoughts. I took over as treasure at my church. We had a safe deposit box and one lady is deceased and another is in a nursing home. It took 2-3 months for anyone to tell us what we needed to do. This box was opened in 1991 and we were grandfathered into a free box. This location is not convenient for any of us. We were told if we moved it there we would no longer be grandfathered in. So we keep and guess what a yearly fee. I complained and was told the manager would not refund it. Whoever the manager was in 2017 was NEVER at work. So I let it go. Then the address got changed without my consent. We got past due notices and I had no idea because the letter was being mailed to the wrong place. I went to another branch they refunded the late charge and fixed the address. We decided this box just a pain let’s close it. Last summer I closed the box. Yesterday I get a bill saying the rent is due. I’m told no one ever removed the box from the system and I have to go in again. Someone needs to know what a disaster this place is. The person responding don’t you dare give me the 877 number. Every time I call they just transfer me to business and then business banking says we don’t have safe deposit box and they transfer me to this same branch.,1,North Carolina,ChIJKUFSFOD_U4gRtkLSfpAYjqc
07/09/2021 18:49:51,Morgan Wing,"Very disappointed in the customer service at this bank. As a young adult, I went in to cash my graduation checks I had received in the mail. The woman cashing my checks was on her cell phone the whole time and didn’t even pay attention to me talking  to her. After leaving the bank she then proceeds to call my fathers business, his personal cell and my mothers phone for her own suspicion. She interrupted my fathers work day and even called me. If she had maybe paid any lick of attention she would’ve realized every single check said “graduation gift”. I understand being suspicious of a young girl withdrawing cash but maybe get your head out of your damn cell phone and pay attention to a customer  and not call the individuals multiple times. I’ve never had this problem at the huntersville bank as the customer service there is amazing.",1,North Carolina,ChIJKUFSFOD_U4gRtkLSfpAYjqc

I just got denied a lease because of this one mark. I’ve tried calling the bank to get this fixed, but was told there was nothing they could do. DO NOT BANK HERE, and honestly drop 5/3.

I went back and talked to a nice man (I didn't get his name unfortunately) and he explained they only have access to 12 month averages.

This is a rip off I go to every other bank and if there is a fee it's usually $8 and sometimes no fee and I have cashed some large checks 10k or more with no charge at FIRST FEDERAL and UNITED BANK. What makes it worse is they did this because I have a dba business account and not a personal account so they treat me as a non customer but I have been a customer here for longer than 53rd has owned the bank. It may be a DBA business account but my name is on it and that's all that should matter. They have the RESOLUTION center call me to only repeat what they already said but not to come up with a resolution to me that a wasted job to give someone just to repeat the rules and not to actually try and come up with a resolution for a problem a customer has.

When I asked the bank manager they had no clue as to why the small amount was bounced. After several attempts they finally disclosed the deception & it appears to me they just want to generate revenue . They did remove half of the bounce fees but there were still 15-20 they left on the account. At $35 a pop it adds fast.

After asking to open a checking account to avoid the fee I was informed that they would then not open the account. Zach Finch became visibly upset by me asking to either open the account or not have a fee. I asked to speak with the Manager Cassie who also refused to open the account and had to end up paying the fee. I have been a customer of 5/3 and had closed my accounts with them due to issues like this. Please for the sake of people you do business without. DO NOT open up an account with 5/3. They will find any way possible to take your hard earned money. Zach needs to attend training for customer service and how to handle issues when they arise.

I don't care what time of day you go, it seems there is only one person working both the inside counters and the drive throughs.

In addition, if you have a retirement account they bug you constantly in the summer to come in and talk to their only ""retirement specialist""??; but when you ask them to please call back after school starts you never hear from them again. When you call to make an appointment you are told their one and only ""retirement specialist""  only comes to the Lincolnton branch one afternoon a month??
I hate to change banks, but I do not appreciate waiting in long lines because the bank is too cheap to maintain satisfactory staffing and for 1 of the only 2 employees present to make a fresh pot of coffee.",2,North Carolina,ChIJyWkxUtPOVogR4jakvf_DetY

After eye rolls from the bank manager and another associate we left with a “what ever” from the bank manager. By the way she was able to help my family after they returned. Still this situation should have been handled much differently.

I have my house mortgage with this bank and they raised my rate for no reason and did not bother to tell me what the new rate was. I transfer money into the account from my regular bank to pay for the mortgage but they decided to charge me excessive over draft fees without telling me so I had to then transfer $92 of my hard earned money to cover these fees. I went to this branch and tried to explain what was going on and the teller was rude and did not care to help out in any way. Do not use 53rd bank.,1,North Carolina,ChIJud9TnfEPVIgRJU7lcfXQYQc

Brian greeted me as soon as I walked in the door, and directed me to Jacob's desk. Jacob impressed me over and over with his depth of knowledge of all things banking and estate (how often does a new widow walk into a bank?). But even more than that... so much more than that... Jacob was remarkably KIND to me. He genuinely cared about me and the situation I was in. He listened to my concerns, asked a few very good questions, and showed me what all my options were. Then he went beyond being a banker and showed concern for my well-being: Having an account balance that wouldn't have bought a few days' groceries, Jacob found a way to keep me financially secure while I sort my way through this very difficult time.  He had no idea who I was when I walked in that door, but he cared anyway. He made a HUGE difference in my life, and took away a tremendous stress that I'd been carrying. Jacob, I thank you, and my husband (I know) thanks you as well. ❤️

Brian, you have a GEM working for you. Having moved here from out of state six weeks before my husband succumbed to cancer, and being a Fifth Third banking member for almost a decade, I am so incredibly thankful to Fifth Third for making me always feel like family. But I want everyone to know that this Fifth Third branch doesn't just SAY they care about their members... they LIVE IT. Thank you!!",5,North Carolina,ChIJKSEC6J1RrIkRkoV3AO2KQnA

In the year 2022, they are unable to process partial payments. Even though their statements show a line for partial payments and even have a descriptor of “unapplied”. So now I have to change the way I pay my bills that I have used for 22 years and has made me debt free with the exception of my home. On top of that, I am now having to get my bank to prove to them that they have received and even cashed 2 payments they claim to have never received.

Today, I was the only person at the drive-through window and there were no customers inside. I sat at the window for at least 5 minutes before having to beep my horn. One representative looked at me but walked by. The other was busy talking to one if their technicians and when she finally came to the window, the excuse was they were short-staffed and were having technical problems. I am on my work lunch hour! Then when I get home, I discovered my deposit was put into the wrong account. So I tried to call to speak to someone and, of course, no one picks up the phone and you can't leave a message so I am having to write a review. I am considering changing banks where service is quicker, attentive, and accurate. Right now, this expectation is met by one of the bank managers, who is exceptional except for the fact that she must also serve customers who meet in her office. An institution this large should serve their customers better by staffing their branches at the teller windows and providing thorough training.",1,North Carolina,ChIJ1VbYRSL5WYgR6CXIASDp91c

I have never been to a bank where the staff feel so comfortable lallygagging, completely oblivious to each customer being in a hurry. I have never hated a bank experience more than each time i walk in there. Let alone, the last time I was in there they changed my personal account information without informing me.

2 days later, still not there. The check posted at the check writers bank for $12.00
NOW 5TH THIRD IS TELLING ME IT MIGHT BE UP TO ME TO GET THE 1138.00 FROM THE PERSON. Because their machine read it wrong and then let it post at the other person's bank.

Called them in their error after 3 days the issue is not fixed, no apologies and more importantly the $800 in interest owed to me is not in my account.  With banks failing right now one would think the bank would act with urgency to fix.  Guess not, if it was their money I am sure it would be fixed by now.  Update, now 13 days from notifying the bank of their error, the interest owed to me for letting them use my money is still not in my account.

08/19/2023 23:34:46,Carolyn Riley,"If I would have read these reviews I wouldn't have wasted my time. My nephew is 19 and I wanted to help him get a bank account and start learning about how the banking process works. I recommended Fifth Third because I used them in the past and they were a good bank. He opened his account at the Cary,  NC location with no issues. He received his first check from his job yesterday and we went to Fifth Third Garner, NC to cash the check. I waited in the car because I wanted him to handled it on his own. He comes out to say they could not cash the check. I asked him why and he said he didn't know. I took him back into the bank to find out what was going on. There were 3 people in the location. The person that helped him stop helping the person he was currently with and asked what we needed. I ask why check couldn't be cashed. The gentlemen looked at me and said he didn't know. I said well we need to close the account then. No reason for him to have an account at a bank that can't cash his work check or tell him the reason they can not. This was a check for a business in Cary, NC and issued by Wells Fargo and I didn't see any issue. I have never ever been told by a bank they couldn't cash a check and didn't know the reason why. The bank employee then says the account can be closed without us being there because the account had no money in it. The account had $5 in it. It wasn't until we left that my nephew told me this. I believe the bank didn't want to cash the check because he ""thought"" the account was empty. The check was only for $93! We went to Walmart and cashed the check for $3. I can understand why no one using this bank. I will be taking him back next week to get his $5 and close the account. Opened another account at PNC.",1,North Carolina,ChIJyxRQwAxgrIkREIBLxpxhlJs

I went to the six forks location asking for a temporary card and didn't get anywhere with the bankers! They gave me an extremely difficult time like they always do😌!

I'm going to stick with the Garner location as of now to continue to receive professional service. Thanks to Russel- The personal banker for being professional and going the extra mile by bringing me my temporary card to my car and being on a conference call while I activated my card.",5,North Carolina,ChIJyxRQwAxgrIkREIBLxpxhlJs
02/24/2017 02:37:47,Amanda Leigh Ford,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK.  What they do is not just unethical, but illegal.  Fifth Third Bank put me in extra products I explicitly stated I did not want (just like Wells Fargo has been sued for), failed to disclose important information about my account, moved my money between accounts without my permission, and got my personal information wrong during account setup so that I could not access my own money.  They were unable to provide any explanation for how these things could have happened and would promise to fix them but never follow through.  It took multiple tries to get me a working debit card, but even several tries at setting up online banking still didn't do the trick.  I closed my account months ago after only a handful of small transactions and am still getting ""overdraft"" notices (I certainly never overdrew it) that no one can explain or stop.  While the tellers were pleasant throughout my many problem-ridden visits, you simply cannot trust the other representatives to be honest with your money.",1,North Carolina,ChIJyxRQwAxgrIkREIBLxpxhlJs

08/04/2023 18:00:32,Anne Kirika,"I have had the worst of banking experience with this Bank. I have been their customer for over 10 years. I moved from Charlotte to Pacific West 2 years ago. Since I could not have direct deposit to this account any more, my account became dormant even though there was money in the account. I wanted to keep the account for the sake of maintaining my secured credit account with them but when I tried to keep the account active, they said the only way was to travel to Charlotte and deposit some money in person. I then decided to close my accounts- checking and savings plus my secured credit card.  A 5/3 representative sent me a form to fill out and send via fax or mail to the my branch (the 5/3 Bank on Pineville-Matthews Rd). When I tried to reach out to the bank for their fax #, they said I can’t close the account any other way but to visit the bank in person! That is not what they had told me before. Tell me how logic it is to fly from the pacific west to charlotte, spend about $600 for a $20 account balance. The bank has been charging a dormant account fee every month and soon the balance will go overdraft.
It is so frustrating!

04/03/2022 04:00:21,Alan Ayers,"The team at the Maxtown (Westerville North) branch is friendly and helpful.  At Fifth Third you get a personal banker and while the toll-free customer service isn't remarkable (and it's not 24/7), I've found the branch is responsive when I've had an issue. I've had a couple of issues with backoffice configuration of the bank's technology--not a fault of the branch--but the branch stayed on top of those issues until they were resolved by corporate.  They are renovating the branch to make it more relational and I love that they're so dog-friendly.  The ""free"" (Momentum) checking is market competitive but I found the second, ""relationship""  banking for my small business to be one of the best values in Columbus. Fifth Third has been focused on customer service so they do send surveys fairly frequently and they follow-up on your comments.",5,Ohio,ChIJh4HfXJH1OIgRK27AYawdyV0

Somehow someone took 9K out of my account. The bank said it was fraud and put my account on hold. Because if this I missed 2 payments.
The bank insured me they would not send the miss payments to the credit department since my account was involved fraud..

The bank did send the missed payments in and my credit dropped 150 points bc of this. Iv disputed the missed payments twice and both times the bank said they reported the payments accurately after telling me they would not report them.

I call my Gahanna branch and spoke with Josh Baker, who looks into it, then calls me back later in the day to verify that the other bank is mailing the check back, and that it would be a couple of days, however, if I came in with the check he would make sure there was no hold on the check.  I told him I'd see him in a few days.
One day later, on Josh's day off, Zach Rodriguez calls me to tell me that they actually went over the the Reynoldburg branch, got the check sitting there to be mailed, brought it to the Gahanna branch, reversed the error, deposited the check AND made sure there was no hold on the check.

I had an unexpected withdrawal from my account. I tried to transfer the money from another account to cover the cost. Unfortunately you aren’t notified of the overdraft till it’s already to late. They would not work with me to reverse the 38 dollar fee.  Even though I had already taken care of the overdraft, before the next business day.  I have five accounts with them, but still that meant nothing. The young girl I talked to on the phone had the nerve to say, “You overdrew your account, but still you kept spending money from store to store”. Again, I had an unexpected charge. Something I thought had been canceled. To me that comment was very rude. Her tone of voice was very rude. I then talked to a Manager who also would not reverse the charge.   This was the last straw for me.  I was already upset with them. Recently I contacte them about refinancing my home. They sent me a list of personal documents I would need. I sent all the requested documents the very next day. I never got a response back. I followed up with another email and still no response. Apparently I wasn’t worth enough money, for this bank to care. Then I had a manager call to see if they were doing a good job. I explained to this manager how I was concerned. I told him about receiving no response to my emails. I’m not sure why he even called because he was shocked I had concerns and did nothing about them.

03/07/2024 23:46:23,Caleb Pearson,I've gotten nothing but grief from Fifth Third since opening a new account. Their customer service is lackluster at best and they don't really seem to care about you after they've secured your money. Customer service simply sends you to their call center where they essentially just tell you to go to the physical location (most likely because thier call centers run on a time quota rather than amount of issues resolved). The problem being that the employees at the physical location are unable to assist with what I need done. Terrible first impression on a new customer and I will most likely be searching for a different financial institution moving forward.,1,Ohio,ChIJoT9Gi8X6OIgRqqa99jG--bA

01/03/2024 02:31:32,Ross Adelmann,"The only reason I’m still with them is because I don’t have the time to switch all the auto pays.  The services are average.  The app is below average.   I have auto pays setup.  When you review them on the app it gives you a button to edit the details.  But it doesn’t work.  It gives you an error message.  A few auto bills increased in monthly cost.  It has taken me several hours and two phone calls and I’m still not finished.  Who puts a button to edit on an app that doesn’t work.  They tell you the only way to edit is to first cancel the transaction even if the next payment is almost a month away.  No instructions to tell you that is what you need to do.  So intuitively if I just want to change the amount one would choose edit, right?   No.  And you can’t change them on the app.  I tried changing another one tonight and hitting cancel doesn’t work either.  So I have to get on with the computer and try again.  Hopefully it will work.  Frustrating.  When life slows down I will find a better bank.  I’m starting a business and my business will bank elsewhere.",2,Ohio,ChIJ8bFg0VBnOIgRWk-JiZM0D9k

This bank is right around the corner from my home. So I went to the Marburg location and of course that one was closed too. Also doesn't open til 10am. Finally make it the Madisonville one which opened at 9. Make it to the car lot of course someone already has the car and decided to purchase it the moment I arrived.

12/17/2022 00:53:18,Mark Salgado ii,I used to love this bank but they had to have a new app and now it's much more difficult to do online banking. Everything is blue and white which is much harder to understand at a glance. It's slower than it used to be. My biometric scan kicks me off every single day. The rate at which the items I purchase get subtracted from my account is much slower than it used to be. If they can't fix these issues soon I'm going to switch banks. Idk if they've ever heard leave well enough alone but wow why on earth this app ever got put in place is confusing to me. Great bank but very poor online banking.

I went to the branch because my checking account was negative when I have money in my savings and I keep trying to move the money that I have on my saving Online and by calling customer service but was unsuccessful. Turns out they attached an old college savings account that I had open for my son years ago at a location that’s not even fifth third branch and had requested to be closed. So when I was putting money into what supposed to be my saving account turns out they closed my actual savings without notifying me so I was actually putting money into the college saving account that I told them I didn’t want to use that I had requested be  closed and didn’t ask them to add into my account. I went I to the branch and person that I was dealing with had no compassion, very rude, and treated me with no dignity, mean and accused me of being loud when all I was trying to figure out was why was that account attached to this one when I didn’t ask for it. He talk me as if I was a dumb person who intentionally choose to put money into an account that I told them I didn’t use and is supposed to be closed, an account that I didn’t open with them was attached/linked into the account that I open with them. They are soo busy trying to get you to open accounts with them that they don’t even take the time to do what you ask them. When I was trying to explain to him what happen he accused me of being loud. I guess when I black woman is trying to make a point she’s loud Woow. I just got up and left hurt and disappointed before he calls the cops for trying to figure out where me money went.  I wish I could of just closed my account right then and there. He lacks customer service skills and has no compassion and was very condescending. I guess I’m the one left to figure out where my money went and how to get it back while they add fees on top of fees onto my account.

12/23/2019 22:52:39,Jodi Golec,I’ve banked with fifth third bank for two years.  I’ve deposited two checks a month from the same company for two years.   A direct deposit for two years.  Tried the mobile app for the first time and they put a 15 day hold on my check 3 days before I had to leave town for a trip that I had already spent thousands of dollars on couldn’t cancel.   I called customer service and they recommended that I go into my local branch.   I went in with the boss of the company who was willing to show proof that the check cleared at his bank.   The manager shrugged his shoulders at me.  He didn’t try to call his boss or corporate or anyone to try to accommodate me.   Completely useless and the worst customer service ever at a bank.   This is the third issue with this bank in a 3 week time period.    I would never recommend this bank for anything kind of account or loan.

Since I was in a hurry, I took the info and told them I would stop in next week.  Watching the commercials about how they donate 150 to cancer research for opening an account made me make the trip back out again.  I have no need for another checking account and this bank is not close to home but couldn't beat the deal.  When I got there, they told me I didn't qualify for the special because I had a checking account with them 7 years ago that I closed but they would gladly open an account for me without donating the money.  TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.  Since I was already there, I asked about a money market.  The rate sounded good but they wanted me to open a checking account to get their rate.  I called around and found that First National was offering a 1.9% rate which was twice the ""temporary"" rate of 5/3.  Not a horrible bank but their deals are nothing compared to what other banks offer and the ""disclaimer"" that doesn't exist anywhere except when you go to the bank about previous accounts tells me there are more hidden scams they will pull once I am in.

We’ve stopped using 5/3 in the past couple months because of this issue. If citizens ATM would have been working we wouldn’t have even deposited this check with them.

I spoke with a customer representative by the name of Maryland on the phone and instead of helping me with my initial concern she actually was rude. Even made remarks as if overdrafting was something I just always done. So after she abruptly ended my call I just went into the branch to see if I can get assistance from another employee, instead of getting me help this lady Maryland came out again to speak with me and was still very rude, she publicly came to talk about my account information in the customer lobby waiting area. She violated my rights to privacy. I have never went through any of this before. It was awful.

08/04/2023 18:00:32,Anne Kirika,"I have had the worst of banking experience with this Bank. I have been their customer for over 10 years. I moved from Charlotte to Pacific West 2 years ago. Since I could not have direct deposit to this account any more, my account became dormant even though there was money in the account. I wanted to keep the account for the sake of maintaining my secured credit account with them but when I tried to keep the account active, they said the only way was to travel to Charlotte and deposit some money in person. I then decided to close my accounts- checking and savings plus my secured credit card.  A 5/3 representative sent me a form to fill out and send via fax or mail to the my branch (the 5/3 Bank on Pineville-Matthews Rd). When I tried to reach out to the bank for their fax #, they said I can’t close the account any other way but to visit the bank in person! That is not what they had told me before. Tell me how logic it is to fly from the pacific west to charlotte, spend about $600 for a $20 account balance. The bank has been charging a dormant account fee every month and soon the balance will go overdraft.

08/04/2023 15:22:04,Sandra Groves,"Beware!  I have been with this bank for almost all my life since I was 16 years old. Savings , checking , mortgage and loans. They lost all my trust this week. First I want to say a few years back when I was getting a loan the banker guy wrote the wrong address down, messing up the whole loan process. I almost didn't get a loan because of his mistake. I ended up having to pay more for the work I was having done on my house because of having to wait longer to get the loan because of his mistake. This week I put some cash into the ATM and the machine messed up. The bank was closed so I had to wait until morning to fix it. The bank said they see where I attempted to put in the money but there was nothing they could do. They just gave me a number to call. I called and made a dispute. I was told the money will be back into my account in 1 to 2 business days. It is the 2nd business day and no money. I have bills and other things I need to pay for and now I will be penalized once again for their mistake. Everyone I have talked to cannot help me. This bank has STOLEN my MONEY and refuse to help me or give it back. I have lost all trust with them. The worse thing a bank can do is steal someones hard earned money away from them and this is what this bank has done to me.",1,Tennessee,ChIJhd2j4_ObZIgR62Vq6vHg_To

This is our 4th time having a issue with fifth third Bank over mobile deposits they left us stranded in Pensacola after we made a deposit they would not let us use our money, they also left us stranded in Colorado after we put our money yet they put a hold on it would not let us use it... Therefore we were stranded again we put our money in the bank worried about someone robbing us when it's the bank that robs us they hold our money up to five days and left us stranded twice.

The  bank employees are unable to fix the problems the bank policies create or out of the office. You will hate this bank go elsewhere they are incompetent.

Having those financials handled properly has been peace of mind for me. I’m probably most impressed with how this bank has handled situations that they needed to fix.

No bank is perfect and we’ve asked a lot of our bank. When they’re had a clerical error or a small oversight they are prompt to admit it and even quicker to fix it. I want a bank I can trust to make right what needs to be right. Now with a new branch manager and the same reliable team they are even better than before.",5,Tennessee,ChIJ4V62Ui-GZIgRsDkkaSW7NS8
05/07/2021 17:31:16,Morgan Hardy,"Was just notified that 5/3's underwriting declined my home equity line of credit application due to 'only' having 20 months in current commission sales job. Because I have an eight year history in commission sales, I can pass the tightest government lending standards - conventional mortgages - but not a HELOC carried on a bank's own books? Further, I currently have a checking account balance with 5/3 larger than the HELOC I was seeking.

If underwriting standards are going to be this tight, 5/3 would be better off discontinuing this financial product until they can figure out a reasonable lending category they can actually offer without wasting people's time and damaging credit scores with a hard pull that doesn't result in a loan.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ4V62Ui-GZIgRsDkkaSW7NS8

Meanwhile, there was a very erratic man in the lobby screaming about getting his *&^&ing money and saying he was going to bash someone's head until their brain matter spills out that was not removed from the premises.

01/03/2018 20:12:20,T T,"Mandee that served me around 13:07 on 1/3/2018 was very unprofessional and rude. The western union is offering mobile service to transfer money and this branch is one of the participating location. The lady told me she is not set up for that and she told me firstly it would be her first time to do it as she has never done it before. I said that is fine, everyone has his/her first time as long as you are tying to help the customer. Later on, she said she is just a flow and never meant to set up to do western union. The branch clearly stated the western union service is supported and would be open til 5 pm. The western union agent confirmed to me the branch should be able to help me and the agent would like to talk to the lady and the lady was unwilling to take the call and said she has many clients in the line. To be frank, I am the first customer before all other clients. You do not skip the clients when you are still serving the current one. It was rude from her side. The managers apologized which is fine and I tried to explain to them what is happening and the western union representative would like to speak to them but one of them is unwillingly to take the call. The managers explained to me of labor shortage and is not able to serve the client. If your store is opened, you should be prepared to serve clients. You could have put a sign saying no western union service available today. However, sign is on. In additions, the staff and managers keep turning me away to another location but I have repeated myself 4 times, the store is not opened today. This branch is horrible, please do not go there.

I didn't see any problem doing it because when I opened the account I made a check deposit in person, coming from the same sender. It turns out that they closed my account and kept the deposit money, justifying that it was fraud. I went to the bank in person 3 times and they didn't tell me anything, only that I had to wait, when I needed access to my account and money to fulfill my responsibilities. A week and a half later they finally give me access to the account. 3 days later they send me a mail  telling me that they are going to close my account in 30 days and DON'T have access to my money AGAIN. What efficient bank does this? It is a lot of lack of consideration and waste of time. Please do not open an account here, that is why they are offering 350 dollars per deposit more than 500 dollars, which they will NOT give you because they are always making trouble.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ4R7f3p5mZIgRaAZBaO7n9uA

I have never seen a banker yell disrespectfully like this before and then ignore her right before. I went in today hoping to see Janet, because she knows my situation. I ended up talking to another lady who is very condescending the moment I met her. I told her it was not letting me log in and I needed to cash a check. She proceeded to ask me questions of things I've done to try to log in, all of which I did of course. Then proceeded to make me feel stupid because I needed help. She then told me to go home, try again, and call customer service. Which I did, then I am still having issues with this bank. My new card is blocked because of too many wrong entries trying to log in. Which of course would happen because when I went in person today to figure this out, the condensing woman was no help.

06/29/2023 01:33:16,elizabeth morse,"I went to a branch in person to apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit on April 21st. I more than qualify for the loan and provided all of the required documentation to the loan specialist on April 27th after opening an account and setting up direct deposit with my employer. I was conditionally approved on May 5th but only after the rate that was advertised as a promotion had changed. I stuck with it because we were working to line up financing to begin a long anticipated construction project and most loans take 30 days to close. In the month that has passed since that conditional approval and offer, I have been jerked around, told that my property is ineligible for a HELOC because it's a duplex (it's not a duplex). I produced additional documentation to make this clear, urged the bank to order an independent appraisal (which is standard process for loan applications), and advocated for myself, for fair lending practices and for transparent review. The communication has been terrible. I emailed on Friday 6/2 and again on Monday 6/5 and got a response late Wednesday afternoon 6/7 inviting me to come in for an in-person meeting on Friday to discuss my application. After almost two months of being strung along, and receiving no reassurance that anyone was on my side, working to support my application, I felt humiliated and so frustrated and stuck. I visited another local financial institution on Monday, completed an application, provided all of the same documentation and have been conditionally approved 48 hours later. I will be closing the account I opened 7 weeks ago, and taking my business elsewhere. This process was unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable. I believe I have the right to have in writing the reasons why my loan was not approved and I am reporting to the BBB hoping to get that documentation.

Update 6/28/23. I have never heard another word from Fifth Third Bank. We are closing on our HELOC with Bethpage Federal Credit Union with a 7.74% interest rate, no closing costs and impeccable attentive customer care just 3 weeks from the day we first applied. I will never do business with Fifth Third again. They even made closing my account a hassle. To think that I was seeking an in person experience! Wow.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ4R7f3p5mZIgRaAZBaO7n9uA

12/07/2022 17:16:59,Andrew Pudlo,I showed up and stood in front for 20 minutes while multiple people showed up and left without getting help. Employees walked right by us without saying anything and were not in a hurry or helpful at all. 10/10 do not recommend,1,Tennessee,ChIJCaXsOgNDZIgRNFUPA51X9uU
11/20/2019 20:17:15,Sara Tucker,This bank (or maybe just this location) is a joke. They had a representative go to my husbands employer trying to recruit new customers so my husband signed up for the account. The next day he received a phone call that they had given him the wrong routing information and that they would be emailing him the correct info. Never got the email or ever heard from them again until we had to go to the bank in person. No apology from them for the mess up. Every time we go in for anything the wait is insane and they are always listening to music very loudly off of a cell phone. Now today we went to deposit a check and went through the drive thru. We sat there for 10+ minutes with no acknowledgement whatsoever so we pressed the call button and was responded to very rudely about how they were busy helping people inside. They FINALLY came back and told us the check was deposited. Now come to find out the check apparently won’t be deposited and cleared until midnight. Way to completely ruin our only day off. We will be closing this account immediately.,1,Tennessee,ChIJCaXsOgNDZIgRNFUPA51X9uU

Just recently, I used the drive through for a deposit and there were no cars in front of me. I wasn't greeted and I waited for ten minutes before receiving service without an apology, even though the banker could see me. He processed my deposit without saying a word or making eye contact.

This last time I waited over 10 mins after they already had my stuff so I called the button and no one answered me. At this point I decide I need to go in, where I got no apologizes or I’m sorry, very unprofessional. I wish they would of at least buzzed me and told me hey it’ll be a little bit of a wait rather then leaving me wondering if they forgot about me....there were 3 of them in the bank and one of me, they could of kept the customer informed. When I go to Rivergate and Hendersonville bank they are super fast and very polite and friendly. I am not sure what is going on with this bank but I definitely won’t be back to this branch anymore and will be driving a couple extra miles to avoid this kind of service.

I stopped in the branch the following Monday morning to try to get my cards back, and the teller informed me that their ATM automatically captures and destroys any cards that are not issued by Fifth Third bank. She said this was standard Fifth Third policy, and then claimed this was standard policy for every other bank she'd ever worked at. Obviously, I've never heard of any bank having this policy, and said as much. I also suggested that, if it was in fact their policy, posting a notice on the ATM that non-Fifth Third cards would be lost and destroyed should be a given. She kind of talked to me like I was an idiot, and made it sound like I should've known better about this ""common"" policy. I called their corporate headquarters when I got home, and was assured by the customer service rep there that Fifth Third has no such policy, and that she'd never heard of any bank with such a policy. As a small business owner, this handcuffs me for the next few days until my new cards arrive in the mail.

We recently set up an appointment to open a new account here and bring some money back in but we’re called the next day to change the appointment.  Their reasoning was the employee that we were meeting with  didn’t know how to open the accounts.  In the past we were able to call and get all our paperwork ready just for us to come in to sign.  Apparently they don’t offer this kind of customer service anymore We closed all our accounts the next day.  They aren’t worth it anymore with so many other banks available.

I was told on four separate occasions that my account was not able to overdraft(that it would be declined). Well that isn't true and it has cost me hundreds of dollars in fees. The employee who did this was fired and they refuse to reverse the fees. I know have deposited my check and to my surprise I have been hit with more fees. So now I have to go two weeks without money to eat or put gas in my vehicle or make my car payment. I have already opened a new account at home federal next door to them and will not recommend anyone to them.,1,Tennessee,ChIJ42Tr_TUjXIgRTbdkTRSo4_I

I came back in with the customer on the phone.  Kevin Kern had a scowl on his face when I came back in.  I advised I have the customer on the phone. He refused to assist.  ??? I asked for the manager, he didn't get the manager.  Another co-worker came out and acted the same was as Kevin Kern.  Is it because of the color of my skin you refused to assist after Kevin Kern told me a phone call would do?  They got offended.  I called them out for being racist.  They yelled at me.

When I call their customer service they continually say “that’s not my department” and transfer me to their title company.

08/27/2018 16:40:51,Kathy Watters,"I opened a line of credit, got a 0% interest credit card, and opened a checking account.  The technology, policies, and processes with this bank are a joke.  I use US Bank, First Tennessee Bank, and have banked in the past with BBT, SunTrust, Chase, and Citi.  This bank's technology compared to the norm in today's industry is laughable ~ circa 2005.  First experience was trying to set up automatic payments on the web.  I had to talk to 3 different departments (general support, web support, and automatic payment department), then receive and snail mail back an old fashioned automatic withdrawal form and wait 30 days for it to be processed to achieve this simple task.  I knew right then I should end the relationship but I did have that 0% credit card balance that lingered.

I paid the credit card balance off on 8/7.  More than 2 weeks after the card was paid off, with a $0 balance on the credit card, 5/3 debited my checking account with another institution for $96.  Again, with a $0 balance.  What did it take to begin to rectify this, which in my mind was theft?  1. A phone call to general customer service who says they are so sorry.  They will have to keep my money for 7 days and then I can call back and have a cashier's check issued and mailed to me.  2. A transfer to the automated payment department to officially request they no longer steal my money each month.  I don't owe them anything but apparently I have to tell them to stop taking my money.

What a JOKE.  I will NEVER deal with them again.  All accounts closed!  I am not a ranter.  I did want others to know what they are getting into.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ42Tr_TUjXIgRTbdkTRSo4_I

I am in the process of looking for a new bank because I am so over the head ache that I has came along with this place. There really should be a Class action taken against them over their ads saying making banking easier. That is a HUGE lie. Their proud of having SSSOOO many ATM's? well I really would like to know where their at because I have been charge more for ATM's then I have had in years. I can use a FREE ATM that I have had used for a long time before I cam to this bank and had NEVER gotten charged and now the bank charges me even though the ATM does not charge the bank. I work for a HUGE money and ATM company that is world wide and know how the systems work and the people with the bank has tried to fill me full of so many lies without them knowing I work for the company I do they really think they are smooth I guess. Please if you enjoy a easy banking life and a bank that will help when you need them and do what they say, RUN as far from this place as you can and if you find a good bank please let me know so I can switch. I am trying to find a good one but stay busy. Good luck guys and hope you find a better bank then this place.

reply to response: Not sure what will come of speaking with you about this? Everyone I have dealt with has plenty of opportunity to make things right and/or help with things and no one has cared before. And not to mention not sure what can be done at a branch level. The bank its self lies and does what it can to get people to join then no longer worsts about you again. Just like a issue I have had the passed 2 weeks of my account getting locked none stop. The people i talk to tries to keep saying its because my log in is wrong but its funny I can log in one minute and it locks the next. Hell I was ASLEEP when the account got locked once and they still tried to say it was my fault. Im dont with this and tired of wasting my time.

04/19/2023 18:53:55,Vrieze Knight,Very questionable Bank. I have had a checking account with them for about 5 months now. And every time I turn around there seems to be an issue with the bank. Firstly when I opened the account up they gave me a voided check. Come to find out when I submitted that information they mistype the checking account. And I had to go through the headache of trying to get my employer to cut me a paper check. Do you think that the bank cared about that. No they just made an excuse. Telling me that I needed to pay more attention. It's never fifth third fault. It's always the customer's fault. The second incident was when charges started disappearing on the account. And then magically reappear 3 Days later causing the account to get overdrafted. Just like what Bank of America used to do. And the reason why they got took into court in a class action lawsuit. But the final straw was when I called them to dispute a transaction. I did not give TurboTax permission to use my checking account to withdraw the cost of their service. I actually paid them with a credit card. So they basically double charged me. I informed this to fifth third. And they said they can't reverse the charges. That I need to contact TurboTax. Which I did and they refused to reverse the charges. Because they have nothing on file of them charging to credit card. Even though the credit card charge had posted. And has been posted for a month. But fifth third wouldn't do the right thing and dispute the charge. They argued on behalf of TurboTax. Just like what Bank of America would do. I legitly have hated every minute of being with fifth third. And now they won't close the account because I have a negative balance. Again I set the account up to not have overdraft protection. And they informed me that there would be no way I could overdraft the account with the setup like that. They are a bunch of crooked people. And I'm in the process right now changing over everything to a new bank. Do not go to fifth third. Unless you like questionable practices.,1,Tennessee,ChIJid82XqtmZIgRbqqHp4IoRoc

06/05/2019 01:29:14,Riane,"Scheduled my rent payment to be delivered on time through their online banking. My payment never made it. My property management assessed a late fee of over $100. When I went to the branch I was assured that they'd take care of the late fee my property management assessed because they error appeared to be on their end. They stopped payment on the ""missing"" rent check and issued a new check for me to take immediately to my leasing office to cover my very late rent. After allowing the required amount of time for the missing check to show up, I was informed that since the due date for my rent is the first of the month and I requested the payment be made on the fifth, that my payment would have already been late. My lease agreement clearly states that a late fee will not be assess until after the FIFTH day of the month. So, if my check had reached my leasing office as requested by the fifth, I would not have been responsible for a late fee. 5/3 seems to think they've landed on some loop hole and are now refusing to cover the late fee they agreed to cover when I was in the office.

A week later, I asked what was taking so long and the the teller blew off my concern.  I was told by the teller that it could take up to 10 days.  That's all good, but would it have killed him to check?  He would have discovered the error.   As a result, my debit card took two weeks to arrive. When I went in to deposit a check, the employees acted like it was my fault the apt number wasn't put in.  The app is ridiculous.

She takes me 360 card, looks at it and puts the information into the computer, after a couple minutes she hands me my card back and says that it had been done. After I had left I noticed that she had transferred my money into my goal setters account.... so I called back, a man that’s been very rude to me before answered and I told him what happened. I had the card but since it was in my mother’s name I couldn’t use it in my account. Why didn’t they women at the branch tell me that instead of doing whatever she thought was right? She obviously needs more training if she wasn’t going to tell me I couldn’t do it like that. So yesterday, I called ahead of time and asked if I could come into set up my own 360 card. When I got there they said that they would be right with me. I waited for a good 15-17 minutes while other customers jumped ahead in front of me. I had to go to a entirely different branch, that was 13 minutes away. When I got there they woman got with my right away it I was only in there for about 5 minutes and she was incredibly nice!

12/21/2021 06:43:05,April Showers,"I have been a customer since this bank was built on East Thompson Lane! Jamal was one one the ONLY bank reps that hands down went above and beyond for any customer at anytime, even 2 mins before they closed the doors.

I recently bought a money order on 9/9/21….the lady asked “would you like a envelope?” I replied,  “Yes thank you!”….the envelope was a standard envelope. I mailed it from my local post office. The person I mailed the money order to did not tell me that they closed their P.O. Box. SO THIS IS WHERE USPOSTAL Services drops the ball…. They can’t find the money order at this point…. The bank has stated they of course have to wait 90 days to reinstate or to refund the money order ( which is understandable) …. So I go to my regular banking location at East Thompson Ln (the turn over and amount of ppl that come through this location is ridiculous) THE SAME LADY THAT GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE tells me that since this is on a Saturday and she doesn’t know how to take care of a transaction like this I will have to wait for the manager on Monday morning. It’s the principle of me having to come back… the fact that this employee is not trained to do her job… it’s the fact that EVERY TIME I walk in this particular location she is utterly rude and acts as if she doesn’t know or like her job.

After calling another location and finding out who the actual manager is “Carlos”and speaking to John at the 8th Ave location (he was very kind and apologized on her behalf and helped me SOOO MUCH) he let me know when new locations are opened they do move bankers around and I was able to find out where Jamal was transferred. I will travel for good service. No joke. I won’t use a particular place just for convenience. I will travel for good service and respect. It may be time to close my accounts anyway and use a different bank. I don’t need someone holding my money or receiving my direct deposit’s to treat me like I don’t matter to them or just be rude and treat me like another number.

08/22/2023 17:33:23,Carole Starr,I've been a customer of this Nippers Corners Nashville TN bank for decades. Their customer service for me has been impeccable. Their Identity theft protection coverage is also awesome. Just yesterday (re customer service) they called me directly to verify if a $250 check I wrote for a local contractor was legit/ok BEFORE they cashed it! A+++ for THAT level of expedient attention to details on my account safety! BRAVO!,5,Tennessee,ChIJaa5HCKx6ZIgRmf44eau8s1k

I called again the next week and left a voicemail for the general manager and no one returned my phone call. I called customer service and file a complaint and once again I didn’t hear back from anyone at this Branch. I tried calling again the third week and I was told only the branch manager could help me with my situation and once again I still haven’t heard back from the branch manager.

05/04/2023 19:05:42,Crystal Thomas,"Honestly, I wish I never opened an account with this bank. Within the first 2 weeks of opening an account here my card was used at a fast food place while I was at work I actually had my debit card with me and neither the rude personal banker Sharon Bennett that works there or the customer service representative could tell me how this happened. Numerous issues with the Mobil banking and my card being blocked by the bank for a $0.83 which almost left me stranded at work from not being able to book an Uber home. I constantly check my account for any suspicious behavior because even after having the card that was compromised replaced I still don't feel like my financial information is secure. I completely understand the 2.3 star rating and honestly they deserve less. I'm currently in the process of closing my account with this bank.",1,Tennessee,ChIJ_1ll4hZnZIgRmhnygljAAl8

All of the staff I spoke with (3 people) were friendly and professional throughout. I did have to wait a bit while all employees were busy helping other customers.

01/14/2021 16:32:22,Graham,"The staff is just...odd. I called to schedule an important international money wire and it was like an act of congress to get it scheduled. Also, one of their personal bankers couldn't complete the wire because they couldn't find the SWIFT code in the system. I went to another branch and it was not a problem. Another time a personal banker engaged in an awkward 10 minute debate with me on the pro's and con's of why I should open a 5/3 credit card with them instead of completing my wire transfer. If you are completing a simple transaction with a teller you are fine but anything more than that consider this fair warning",1,Tennessee,ChIJ_1ll4hZnZIgRmhnygljAAl8
10/24/2020 09:43:08,jason j watt watkins,"Based on two fairly recent experiences including yesterday October 23 2020.

1.  On a first occasion approx 1 month and half to 2 months ago upon the completion of me cashing a check in the drive thru, the two tellers proceeded to give me information about a particular investment program. No problem until it started feeling like their approach was trying to “be in my financial business”. She asked me specifically “how much do you have in your account” and her possibly seeing I was a bit hesitant then said “do you have over $15,000.00 in account?  During this first encounter I was told I could participate in the program if I had a minimum of $15,000.00 in my account.  So finally, I was told by the branch manager on this occasion that I would receive a call at an appointed time from a financial advisor that worked at this branch. Never got a call nor voicemail message, email or any communication about it.

Second occasion similar to the first I went through the drive thru and cashed a check. It seemed to me that the teller working got hostile with me during a point in this encounter. Because of the above mentioned, first encounter, I decided to go in and speak to someone about this present (second) drive thru encounter as well as the first. That was handled pretty ok as the branch manager agreed with me that she noticed the particular teller does seem like she smarts off to people and is short sometimes with them. In the branch managers words she said she would talk to that teller about it.

Proceeding to speak with the branch manager about me not getting a previous call from their investment officer about investing (which I told her I was interested in and was looking forward to the call) she then started telling me more about that program again, and that they can possibly get my auto loan interest rate down and even said she was interested in helping me get on more of a saving path. After hearing her start off saying that the investment program started at $15,000 (my first visit) to her saying “oh it’s actually $10,000” (this second visit), to dialing a number on the phone saying she was calling Jarrid, her investment advisor and seeming still quite flirtatious and seeming to make sure she placed her wedding ring hand strategic in my sight, it became apparent she wasn’t taking me serious and it were some type of game to her (I even noticed similar actions at my first visit).  Even upon her dialing a number to reach Jarrid, she only let the phone ring three or fou times before hanging up and not bothering to leave a voicemail message.  And again she said, “I’ll have him call you”.  And of course at the appointed time, again, no call.

Although I use fifth third while here in Nashville on business, I will not be looking to communicate with anyone at the branch, use any of the services or the like at the Rosa Parks Nashville TN branch. It’s probable this is a bias toward or against me from the same person, the present branch manager. Only they know what their true intentions are/were. However I am well versed in reading beyond a smile, extra unjustified rhetoric and the “how are you doing/have a Beeaauuutiful day and occasional “I’m sorry that...”

I just look at this and quite a few other similar instances encountered since being back in this city as very Unprofessional. It seems to be justifications and excuses for people’s out of pocket/unprofessional behaviors, but no real resolutions. This contributes to deterioration of this Metro Center, Bordeaux/Jefferson Street and/or African American Community.  And again, maybe they are interested in deterring certain persons from associating with that branch. Idk. Again it could just be “a person of my stature” experience or not.  Or just bias from her.

I thank the one African American man that notarized a signed contract I had with a venue to host and perform at a club/bar venue. Myself, my co manager and a venue owner received excellent and appreciated notary services in this case.

Sincerely",1,Tennessee,ChIJ_1ll4hZnZIgRmhnygljAAl8

01/04/2017 21:31:46,Kercheif Johnson,I am from New York came in town on business caught a cab to grab a quick bite to ear I am not a customer but that was the first atm we saw it was one of those atm's that a little hard to tell which way to insert the card I put my card chip side in because that of course is the new thing right? ? Wrong instead of just saying can't read and spitting my card back at me like bad food as most normal atm's do this one shredded my card no warning I didn't even push a single button!! At first I just thought my card was stuck so we pulled in the drive thru only to be rudely told that my card was shredded and since I wasn't a customer tough tittle. I was devastated there are no signs forewarning customers that this can and will happen if a simple mistake is made. But because of this I was stranded in Tennessee for an extra two days no money because my financial institution couldn't get me a card faster than 2day delivery which costed me a couple of hundred dollars at the hotel I was staying at (I was lucky they let me stay) considering I didn't have a way to pay them I survived off the free breakfast they offered. I will never use this bank or go to their atm again this atm left me penniless and stranded for two day's. Oh I didn't mention that I'm paralyzed from the waist down from service to my country but after this experience I couldn't just think about myself I thought about the elderly and so many other's who this occurred to. So I had to post because after I spoke to the branch not only do they recognize that their atm  shreds cards but despite the many complaints they receive apparently atleast five I repeat five a day. They still refuse to add a simple sign or update their atm great customer service fifth third encore encore!!!,1,Tennessee,ChIJ_1ll4hZnZIgRmhnygljAAl8

New branch manager Veronica Rojo took his place (maybe temporarily) and did not uphold the agreements about overdraft fees. My account got into the negative and I was told by Veronica that they will not put my account on hold. I needed my account on hold so I would not incur any more extended overdraft fees as I was paying off the balance (was only -$140). I was told by Veronica that she cannot place my account on hold and cannot refund any of the $25 extended overdraft fees because I had “reached my limit on overdraft forgiveness” when I know for a fact the last branch manager would have waived at least a couple of the fees as I am a financially struggling full time student. I then asked Veronica what would happen if I lost my debit card. She stated she would then put my account on hold! ??? Can someone make that make sense? “So if I lie and say I lost my debit card this would solve my problem?” Veronica then proceeds to bring up “ethics” and try to preach to me about how that would be wrong. Over a few $25 overdraft charges. Absolutely ridiculous. STAY away from ANY 5/3 bank that is being managed by Veronica Rojo, she will not work with you or give any leniency if you are a 5/3 client.

We went to a local bank and didn't feel like we were being manipulated and lied too. I think there are far better and more trustworthy banks out there.,1,Tennessee,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
07/30/2021 19:57:56,Liv D,Spring Hill Fifth Third is truly an awesome and trustworthy bank. They are quick and dependable yet friendly and I always leave smiling. The all staff are knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions!,5,Tennessee,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
11/14/2018 19:18:00,D Hillebrand,"This is long, but needs to be explained.  I have been with this bank for over 5 years.  I used my debit card on October 30, 2018 to pay off a large debt of a little over $5100.00.  I received a ""fraud alert"" text because of the large amount.  I responded to the text, making it clear that I had indeed made the transaction.  I received an acknowledgement back via text indicating that the transaction was approved and that I could continue using my card as normal.

I was out of town for over a week. Upon arriving back home yesterday, I attempted to use my debit card. to buy groceries. It was declined.  Highly embarrassed, I called the 1-800 number on the back of my card.  Long story short, after almost two hours, three further calls, three dropped calls during transfers on their end, long conversations with both 5/3 reps AND World Pay reps (5/3 Bank outsources their fraud services),  I was told that my debit card was had been canceled on October 31 due to fraud!!!  And, NO ONE had a clue as to WHY.  In the end, I was told that I must speak to someone at my local branch for assistance.

I contacted my local branch first thing this morning...then called the branch again two hours later when my phone messages and email  went without response.  I demanded to stay on the phone until Michael Logue could speak with me.  Michael looked into the matter, and informed me that the debit card had indeed been cancelled October 31st due to ""fraudulent activity.""  (Duh...I knew that much already!)  He said that there was no ""documented"" reason for the cancellation.  His only explanation was that Fifth Third debit cards have a $5000 limit...never mind how much you have in the bank.  Never mind that you have a PIN.  Never mind that you verify at the time of the transaction that you are the actual owner of the account, that it is YOUR money, and that you approve the debit.  He could not explain to me why I was never notified in any manner (not a further text, not an email, not a phone call, not even freaking snail mail).  He could not explain to me why a replacement card was never ordered.

So, for two weeks I didn't know my debit card was cancelled.  For two weeks, several automatic payments I had set up to pay via debit card were being rejected (payments to auto-fill prescriptions,  payments to my physician, subscription services, that do not accept other payment methods, etc.).

Now, after two days of pursuing answers and many stressful hours of frustration, dropped calls, rude people, incompetency,  and bungling by the bank, all I know as fact is:
1. Fifth/Third cancelled my debit card,
2. No one at the 1-800 national level OR at my local Spring Hill, TN branch can definitively tell me who canceled it or why,
3.  No one at the 1-800 national level OR at my local Spring Hill, TN branch has a CLUE as to why I wasn't notified in some manner,
4. Apparently no one on Earth has a clue why I wasn't at least sent a new card to replace the one they canceled and
5. It will take, according to Michael Logue, 5-7 business days to get a freaking replacement card!!!  Well isn't THAT special?  They can deny me access to my own money with the snap of a finger and not be able to explain why everything ""fell through the cracks"" (as Michael so eloquently put it) yet they can't expedite me a new card???

Meanwhile, their cluster-&#$@ has cost me over $700 that I know of thus far, including the additional interest charged on the initial transaction that I had APPROVED and that I thought was paid.  I'll be spending the rest of the day calling my creditors trying to humbly explain that the bank thoroughly screwed me.  I'll have to pay them all with a CREDIT CARD, since I don't have any access to my own money except by check...and NO ONE takes checks!!!

Not that it matters, but I am widowed, on disability, 63 years old, and have to manage my money VERY tightly.  This ordeal will likely deplete my emergency fund. This isn't the first raw deal I have gotten from 5/3 Bank, but it will definitely be my LAST.",1,Tennessee,ChIJuVc0RL54Y4gR23cCcv4a9tU
05/03/2021 14:54:08,Rob Hutchison,Fifth third bank Spring Hill Tn has the most incompetent mortgage dept. If your thinking about obtaining a loan from this particular bank I would advise you to go elsewhere.

11/17/2020 18:32:17,Brantley Larch,This bank has policies that change according to what’s convenient. I opened my account a year ago with a check from my retirement company. It was available in 24 hours. I deposited a check from that same company last week and was told it would be held for ten days after being told it would be available on the next business day. Poor business ethics and horrible customer service. If you want a reliable bank I would not recommend them and I will be closing my account as soon as they release my funds from my last deposit.,1,Virginia,ChIJ9VUE92wrT4gRhu_vP6cB63s

This review is to let people know that this branch is not willing to help at all. They won’t  do anything to just make a wire because according to the noisy teller a wire may take longer then 5 minutes because their system crushes all the time lol really funny. So if you need to do a wire please make an appointment because if they are busy they won’t do it for you.

09/16/2016 14:12:05,Bethany Hill,Never use any 5/3 bank! Someone on the inside will make fraudulent purchases from out of state then close the account as if it didnt exist. Luckily a recorded phone call with one of their reps was recorded so they were able to see the account had existed at one time. FBI was involved and a class action suit is secretly in the works. Took almost a month to get every penny back but bank offered nothing while they basically held on to over $3000. Yeah crooks waited until a large bonus payroll check had been deposited before they started the scam. Even paid monthly fee for the fraud protection and this still happened. And just 2 weeks this branches atm didnt dispense $60 but stated pending on the account. They said the atm wasnt working correctly and had to wait til the transaction went through. They are still holding on to the $60 and havent even made contact. This bank is awful. Will be leaving these crooks this weekend.,1,Washington,ChIJN-OlrchIa4gRZ-gFbDBOlvM

12/22/2022 22:57:47,Matthew Green,"This is the finest team of employees ever assembled! From the bottom all of the way up. The branch is very clean, and the atmosphere is very casual, including the lighting. I have been a member of this branch for about 5 months, and didn't have any bank accounts for many years, due to my unfortunate outcomes with another Fifth/Third branch far from here. Cash app banking held me down for quite some time, and I still use them. But the need to have a real account, and my location brought me back to the West Washington location. I was very weary of starting an account with this company, but I must say, I have been very impressed with the entire team, their professionalism, and their ability to create harmony through teamwork, and I have never appreciated that moreso than I do now. My maturity has me trying to establish credit, and Fifth/Third has given me the ability to do that with their program, that allows you to establish just that, by only starting a second account and putting a balance in savings, and then they simply send a credit card with a limit, and each time you pay your balance back, it raises you score a little, and occasionally raises your limits to a higher level. It was too easy, and very needed by me. The branch takes security very seriously, and you will be faced with the metal detector at the entrance, but you simply empty your pockets of unneeded personal effects, prior to entering the building. When you enter, stop walking while facing the inner door, you will be scanned automatically, and then you will see the green light on the doorframe in front of you. Then you enter. It's that simple. You will inconvenience yourself if your pockets or purse/bookbag etc. are full of metal objects. After my first visit, I have never had any problems. So don't let your first time falling off of your bicycle prevent you from enjoying your experience in the future. It's for our safety as well. And it's absolutely necessary.

I passed by the branch to make quick transaction, as I have business meeting in couple hours later!
the banker issue me new prepaid card as i lost my original card, and i asked to make sure card is activate though, the amount has been transferred according to her.
Two hours later my new card was declined time after another ?
i and up missing my deal cuz there's no enough $ in it to make the purchase cuz the transaction wasn't done from the beginning !

I and up losing my deal, and $200 of the trip expenses on top of that, and I had to drive for more than two hours back home to come back tomorrow maybe with better chance .

09/12/2015 14:18:26,Bern Kampsen,"I've had a few overdraft charges, most of which were caused by their internet banking not updating in a timely manner or not including all transactions.  Their account balance notification system is irregular and not reliable; sometimes never alerting me to minimum balance conditions.  Mobile banking recently rejected a deposit I made using my smart phone THREE DAYS after the deposit was ""successfully"" posted.  Some electronic and wire transfer deposits have taken up to three business days to show up in my account.",1,Washington,ChIJA0H350BHQIgR7ZKO6YoOAMY

They tried to use the excuse of ""your employer doesn't have the funds in their account to cash the check"" Instead of doing the right thing and taking accountability for their mistake.. we called employer to confirm what the bank said, and informed us that what we were told was in fact, not true.

Instead of trying to assist me in a banking issue, he tried to sell me on a credit card that I didn't need. The banking corporation itself is a scam; they charge unlimited overdraft fees without warning, they find ways to have overdrafts happen in sneaky ways, they were even sued for this year ago in a huge federal lawsuit because of this kind of problem. Chase bank is much better in many ways; I am so glad I switched, and I will never go back.  Did I mention they also had my car towed from their parking garage when it wasn't even banking hours? So even when I quit going to their bank because they kept taking my money, they somehow find a way to take me money AND my car. Worst bank EVER.",1,Washington,ChIJQ62pf-dmbIgRYq3AoGLEXsE

I don't have a finance degree or business background and I can tell them how to do their jobs! Unfortunate, sad, and a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I just needed an insurance claim check signed by 5/3 because that is how the state of Indiana does things, and they refused to sign it!

02/09/2018 20:58:51,Emma Doud,"It's taken me a few months to get to this review, but factors keep compiling to make me think even worse of Fifth Third.  We thought it would be useful to have a bank with a local branch - which might be true if it was not Fifth Third.

Our first mistake was going with them on our home mortgage.  They were attentive and enthusiastic until we were under contract on a home.  In which case they promptly gave our paperwork to someone who was on vacation and let it sit on their desk for 2.5 weeks.  We had to push back the closing date, and almost didn't close, because no one on their end seemed to be interested in doing their job.  In the end we were calling almost hourly to make sure they were still working on things, and I started praying that the sale would fall through because of this and we could just start with a new bank.

We have a bank account with them solely to pay our mortgage.  It gets locked every month when someone attempts to login using our username.   Phone and in person customer service are measly to absent.   Doing anything useful with said bank account is near impossible.  But honestly I wouldn't trust them with my money anyway.  This place is the definition of why brick and mortar banks no longer exist.  None of their branches in Bloomington even have the ability to count your change.

Noticed an unauthorized transaction all I got was the phone number to call the company that was nonexistent and my money was never recovered. On top of that I tried closing out my account and had to have my account zeroed out after zeroing my account out apparently there’s 30 days that transactions can come out of your bank account they will charge you overdraft fees for.

I got received my check and brought it to Fifth Third to deposit into my account and the clerk, Renee, was incredibly stand offish immediately. She just repeatedly told me that the check was ""not good"" and that she ""doesn't like the look of this.""  She ""called"" someone at the bank the check was coming from (Truest?) and told me that they verified that the check wasn't good. I took the check and went to the nearest Truest bank and got them to verify the check for me, and was told I could deposit it into Fifth Third, and if I had another issue to have Fifth Third contact them. I went back to Fifth Third and deposited the check. I woke up the next morning to find it on a 10 day hold (I was told by Renee that there would not be a hold) I wake up the next day and my account is being closed for fraudulent activity and I am $500K in the negative. I call Fifth Third and they were extremely unhelpful. I explained that I have legal documentation that proves the case is legitimist. I gave the contact information for the law firm that represented me. I explained that i went to the bank where the money is being issued from and THEY said it was all good. They told me i have 30 days to pay it all off. Fifth third told me to my face that the settlement i appeared in front of a judge for is a scam. They told me to my face that they know I am lying, even with all the evidence. They have now put me half a million dollars in debt because they refuse to admit to any fault on there part.

Weightless is the feeling I get when I walk through those branch doors.  The two wonderful ladies behind the desk, both whom wear glasses are the best duo's I've ever seen do what they do and do it right.  Personally I've had some really amazing times going in to different 5/3 banks here in Indianapolis.  The one over on binford blvd  between 56th and allisonville road was really where I began my build towards trust for banks.  Then sadly I had to move away from them and started to come here since it was closer to home and work..and man, since Day 1 they welcomed me in, joked with me, talked to me as their self, shared some great information on how I can build credit, just did what natural genuine people do!  This bank makes me want to bring and buy them food and treats like that's how special they are!!  I can tell they've been there for years (which is a great sign because nowadays the turnovers are unreal), they all have great communication with each other, the branch manager talks to you without her title ever getting in the way.  I mean all out 5/3 has been great in selecting and training the best people because of the 2 locations Ive been at so far I once have not felt like just a number but rather respected and cared for as a person of my own identity.  Thank you 5/3 for truly sticking to your roots and remembering that we all are human, we all have a heart and soul, and not falling into the mediocrity of life but rather enriching lives not just your own.  I pass on my experience and hope the next one shares their great experience as well. KEEP IT UP",5,Washington,ChIJTdaXtItLa4gRd-NSxDW_O8E

11/17/2020 18:32:17,Brantley Larch,This bank has policies that change according to what’s convenient. I opened my account a year ago with a check from my retirement company. It was available in 24 hours. I deposited a check from that same company last week and was told it would be held for ten days after being told it would be available on the next business day. Poor business ethics and horrible customer service. If you want a reliable bank I would not recommend them and I will be closing my account as soon as they release my funds from my last deposit.,1,West Virginia,ChIJ9VUE92wrT4gRhu_vP6cB63s

A few weeks after my visit to the branch this person even called me on my cell phone to make sure I had got my new debit card in the mail. ...I will look at my bank folder later and mention her name....this person definitely deserves recognition for her outstanding service.,5,West Virginia,ChIJp4dCn4HiRYgR20I7oqDShQ0
03/17/2022 12:04:18,Todd Daniels,"Worst customer service experience last few days. Closed one account opened another due to upcoming divorce. Had to make 3 trips to bank to get debit card to work, which was fine by a manager that was training which I found later was probably the problem with why the person doing my closing and opening of account didn't know what she was doing. She lied to me, answered all my questions wrong. It was a terrible experience. I will definitely not ever change anything again rather than just closing out my account completely. Total nightmare",1,West Virginia,ChIJp4dCn4HiRYgR20I7oqDShQ0

Unfortunately, late last night when someone NOT me was attempting to charge $350...crickets. I'm glad I caught it, but now I have to wait 5-7 business days until a new card comes in. Why does the customer have to suffer? I'm traveling, don't have access to my money, multiple bills/memberships are linked to this card, and it's two days before Christmas! I'm glad I got all my shopping done or I'd be screwed. So, with this Gurnee location. I tried calling this branch location twice around 9:05am this morning. The first time, I heard them pick up and then immediately hang up the phone again. The second time, they let it ring until it transferred to 5/3's main help support line, even though I was trying to get a question answered from that specific location. I would love if 5/3 sent me an email asking to fill out my experience on the fraud, but nothing has come through. There has to be a better system developed to get a new card.

We've had other issues in the past, and although we were frustrated when our local branch couldn't assist us, it was always do to security protocols which I can appreciate.

11/10/2022 23:09:46,Washington Manor-Waukegan,"I went to Fifth Third bank in Gurnee on Grand and Milwaukee to get something notarized there was 5 customers in line - there was 2 tellers behind the counter, 2 gentleman bankers in an office, 1 lady in an office and NO ONE at any of the desks in the lobby  - the 2 tellers were taking care of the lobby as well as the drive thru - when the 2 bankers in the office saw me they shut the door. I asked the teller if they had a notary - she said have a seat and wait. One of the teller went and got one of the banker out of the office, I'm thinking great they will help get the line down and take care of the customer here waiting - but NOPE - they both huddle over a computer for quite some time. When I went over to the other teller to ask if they have any idea how long it would take - she said ""do you have an account here? didn't she tell you to have a seat and wait"" I said I was just wondering how long this is going to take - they said don't know. I am thinking are there any more people working that can help. The banker, teller still huddling over the computer, other banker in the office, and the lady in the other office just is new just started working there this week. I have never seen such a poorly run Fifth Third bank before. Other Fifth Third banks are GREAT Libertyville, Mundelein, Waukegan, Fort Myers, Cape Coral, I've been to a many Fifth third bank for services never had such poor customer service. Very disappointing; this is my first at this bank. Very disappointing. Standing waiting customer is certainly not a priority at this bank!! When I said I could not wait since they could not give me a time frame - they smiled and said goodbye. This was middle of the day at 3:30 PM on a Thursday. For me to take my time and write this out show how bad the service was there  and hope to save people frustration - for the lack of personnel to run this site maybe they should consider shutting down this site.",1,Wisconsin,ChIJExDFfgiSD4gRfkPkRqnJzqM
05/15/2022 09:11:09,Elizabeth Enlow,"I contracted Covid on 10/4/21 it left me with severe side effects. I was able to talk by end of December and I called the bank’s financial hardship department for help in paying since I had lost my job and couldn’t work for months. They told me that if I could pay $209 by the 18th of January it would help my credit. The person I spoke to put the payment thru on the 31st and the next day my $9 in my checking had turned into negative  -$199. I have no money and I don’t start my job again until the 10th. You decide what this banks worth is. The worst part was the person who answered my call in regard to this said “and what would you like ME to do ?” He told me to call them back again and it’s been 4 days. The next person told me to remain professional and all I said was I hadn’t and wouldn’t eat tonight. Apparently that was offensive to this person too.

A financial hardship program helped me get back on track with the bank. FYI to all. .",4,Wisconsin,ChIJExDFfgiSD4gRfkPkRqnJzqM

It took her ages to email us back even. Everytime was a different change and the only way I would find out about the change was when i contacted her. She needs to learn how to communicate to people.

04/09/2015 21:44:42,Alan Haarsma,"We left 5/3  8 or 9 years ago b/c of the incompetent help. {Passing our money to the car next to me in the drive through, and then telling me there is nothing they can do about it,etc.,etc.} Several months ago we were suckered back in b/c of cheap interest rates on a credit card.My wife spent an hour and a half in this branch trying to get an additional user on the credit card. Filled out paper work so they could fax it in and have another card in three days and save a bunch of mailing time. That was nearly 4 weeks ago and we now find out nothing was ever faxed from this branch and no one knows what happened to the paper work. It is a good thing banks have a lot of money to waste because if I ran my business like this I would be out in a year. Sad to see nothing has changed in the last years that we were there.",1,Wyoming,ChIJo_LnJo6xGYgRUeKrykDyIZ4
10/02/2018 18:26:16,Joshua Holler,I've had 3 checks in the past 3 months get declined from fifth third for no reaaon!! They give you a slip with a number to call and the only information you get is that it doesn't meet their standards for no reason. So I then for the third time have to go to the bank it was written from. It's getting harder and harder to bank with fifth third. These aren't even personal checks it's ridiculous. I'm so tired of this what's the point of banking with you guys then. Hands down the worst bank I've had there's absolutely no reason to continue banking with them,1,Wyoming,ChIJo_LnJo6xGYgRUeKrykDyIZ4
09/25/2019 01:18:44,Sandy Blackwell,"Been a customer since 1983. Recently completed a bankruptcy. I continued to make payments to fifth third outside of bankruptcy. I would recieve letters telling what my monthly payment is. Last one I received was last November.  My bankruptcy was closed in February.  Little dud I know, fifth third raised my payment. Never sending any documents stating it. I did not know until I started receiving calls from their collection department.  It took another month for them to give me a statement.  I believe at this point I've had to pay around 200 in late  fees. I had made payment on time each month in amount of what I was last told. I'm very disappointed and want the world to know how they treated me.",1,Wyoming,ChIJo_LnJo6xGYgRUeKrykDyIZ4

Want me to send them a written letter and notary with my ID to access funds in an account I’M the owner of. Just ridiculous and an outdated method of banking.

12/23/2021 22:02:56,Johnathan Barber,"Let me tell you-- as someone who has banker friends at US BANK, FIFTH THIRD, and HUNTINGTON-- this bank has the laziest staff.   I walked into the branch today at 4:39PM.   There were at least three men behind office desks for new accounts, and I counted two customer service clerks.  I told the young man that I simply wanted to move a few hundred dollars from one of my accounts to a new account.  The young man looked at me, hesitated, and said, ""Unfortunately, there is not enough time to do that, sir.   With it being this late in the day, it would take too much time.""

I would never say that an entire bank is horrible based on one experience.  I have used Fifth Third for many years, and the Finneytown Branch is my favorite.   However, SOMEONE needs to retrain the dazed, baked young man with brown hair and a very strong eyeglass prescription.   It only takes 13 minutes to open a new account, and the bank had NO other patrons.   He told me to go to a bankmart at a local Krogers.",1,Wyoming,ChIJU6EJOrBNQIgRGun3q8X84vs

Pushing you to buy credit identity alert.  Charged me $5 a month in my ""savings"" account. The only reason I keep an account with 5/3rd is that they are open late.
