04/13/2023 20:47:14,larry golden,"This review is for Shannon Everett ""relationship banker #11"" . My father and I went in to that bank yesterday needing some work done to his checking. Shannon was extremely Helpful.  Shannon is so friendly and caring. She made my dad and I feel as if we were family. My father means the world to me. So I am very concerned about the way he is treated.  Shannon made sure all of his needs were taken care of. I can not thank her enough for that. She made sure my father and I were comfortable and the nicest part of all ,,,,,she greeted him by his first name ....remembering it from almost a year ago.......Now that is amazing!!!  She deserves all the Kudos That I can give. I hope her supervisor reads this and acknowledges her in front of all her peers!!!!!!! Thank you Shannon for a job well done~~~~",5,Colorado,ChIJfa0zRdWq54kRijhwwYe64XM
04/16/2022 17:08:39,Jamal Chambers,"My child (under 16) needed to cash a Webster check from a previous job. Initially one of the employees was great but we couldn't set up a minors account due to a system problem. Upon returning the next day, the new manager working couldn't help me. She refused to, stating the woman the previous day was helping at her own discretion and she couldn't. I went to the Windsor branch, and magically they cashed my daughter's paycheck and set her up with an account. Although not everyone was rude, but this was unacceptable.",1,Colorado,ChIJfa0zRdWq54kRijhwwYe64XM
07/20/2019 15:01:08,Cristina Ramirez,"I have an account here and banking is fine. But if you have private information you want to discuss in one of several offices they have empty there, you are told they are working behind the counter so you need to talk to them there, in front of everyone, so the person in line behind you can hear exactly what is your request. Other banks use their private offices so you can quietly discuss your request and they can present you with options. It is unsettling that you need to discuss a private matter in front of everyone.",3,Colorado,ChIJfa0zRdWq54kRijhwwYe64XM

09/03/2020: still no change. Pretty sure I am going to drop the account. No one should have to sit in a car in the sun this long waiting for service to get their own money. They don't even seem to care. No improvement.

05/10/2019 16:21:37,Chris mancini,Worst bank branch ever tried to cash my paycheck with 2 ct state ids one my drivers license  and the other my medical card both of which are photo ids issued by the state. They refused to accept my medical card as a second Id  something I've  been using for 6 months at other branches without an issue. I believe I was denied because it was a medical card which I believe is discrimination. The manager was extremely short with me and rude. I'm currently looking for a bank to open an account with and this  bank will not be the one.,1,Colorado,ChIJfa0zRdWq54kRijhwwYe64XM

01/04/2024 23:49:38,Carolyn Venceslau,I have banked with Webster in Glastonbury for over twenty years and they have always served me well.,5,Connecticut,ChIJOTmZj49R5okRwf8x3DyxkpE
05/23/2022 19:07:27,Kristina,"I don’t think I’ve ever written a review of any establishment as I work in a customer service type role myself and I’m aware that many things can go on behind the scenes that can influence a customers experience. However, I was so bothered by the experience I had with the staff at this Webster branch the other day, I felt the need to say something. Thursday morning on my way to work I inadvertently left my wallet on the roof of my car while getting gas and drove off. Upon realizing it hours later, I called the gas station I was at as well as the local police department to see if it had been turned in, which it had not. Realizing I had no cash on me and just enough gas to get from New London where I work, to the closest branch that I am aware of in Glastonbury, I left work a few minutes early to get there. Knowing that I had no license due to my wallet being gone, I figured my work ID that provides a photo ID
,government issued with a security chip, as well as my full social would be enough to verify my identity and take some money out as I literally had nothing in my possession. Wrong.

I walked in and the only person to acknowledge me was a young blonde who was pleasant and willing to help once I explained my situation…until her co-workers overheard. I soon realized she must have been new. I heard one of them say “uh uh… do you know her. Who is she?” Another one quickly intervened and the whole exchange took a turn. Apparently my work ID was useless despite it being government issued because it doesn’t have my signature on it. I quickly offered to provide my full social and was repeatedly dismissed. The teller who took over explained she would have to call the branch I opened the account at. Ok, fine. After a few minutes she comes back and basically told me she’s “doing me a favor” by even considering this as she handed me a withdrawal slip. I filled it out and signed it. At which point she nearly threw it back at me and said “it doesn’t match! It’s not even close to what we have on file!”  ….. ok. So you mean the signature I used 10 years ago when I was 22? Once again I offered to provide my full social and was dismissed again. At this point I’m upset and crying as a very stressful situation is becoming more stressful and I feel like I’m being treated like a criminal trying to steal someone else’s money.  The teller tells me she’s “sorry” but she’s trying to protect my identity. Uh huh. Right. So after me basically begging for them to allow me access to my own money, the lovely teller whose name I did not get, finally agreed to let me withdrawal my money. But remembered to remind me she was doing me a favor. Right. This lovely lady who put me through hell for a 200 dollar withdrawal, who was so concerned about my identity, and also refused to give me a temporary bank card… at the end of all that, since she was so concerned about protecting my money and my identity… you’d think she would have cancelled my lost card, right? No. No, she did not.
As I found out today after going to the Enfield branch and dealing with a much kinder staff who allowed me to withdrawal money based on the identification I provided and also gave me a temporary card so I wouldn’t have to go through that again.

I apologize for the length of this review, but other than filing a formal complaint, this is the best I can do. To the young blonde who was training that day, thank you for trying to be helpful. Im sorry you had to end your day like that.",1,Connecticut,ChIJOTmZj49R5okRwf8x3DyxkpE
05/26/2020 19:27:19,Beth Devine,I got to the drive through 15 minutes before they closed. There was one person in front of me.  They took so long that 3 people in the other lane went through. When I moved to the other lane they closed. It was after closing but they should have realized someone might have been waiting behind the person in the first lane. I called and was put on hold then disconnected and the machine came on when I called back. I have been banking with Webster for years but won't be going back to this branch.,1,Connecticut,ChIJOTmZj49R5okRwf8x3DyxkpE

11/13/2020 20:14:30,W Tarfano,"The employee’s of this Webster Bank location need training on the meaning of customer service.

I have been a customer of Webster Bank for 20+ years, I am now seriously considering finding a different bank. Disappointing to say the least.",1,Connecticut,ChIJOTmZj49R5okRwf8x3DyxkpE
06/25/2016 18:40:11,Serena Iacobucci,"The drive through at this location is painfully slow. No lie, I have sat waiting in the drive up line for 10 minutes. This is totally unacceptable. Every now and again the drive up service will be relatively fast but for the most part it's just plain awful. They appear not to have a dedicated person handling the drive up. I live on the East Hartford/Manchester side of Glastonbury and often find it easier to go to the Webster Bank on Silver Lane in East Hartford because it's so much faster. It's a shame this is the only Webster location in Glastonbury. Stop being cheap and hire more help!",2,Connecticut,ChIJOTmZj49R5okRwf8x3DyxkpE

I dont use zelle for my business very often but i dont have the time to be on the phone with them 45-1hr 15min everytime.

I see now that different banks offer better interest rates on their saving, money market, and CD. I reached out to the bank manager to see if they could provide a better interest rate for some of my accounts.  I was told she will get back to me in three business days. It's been three weeks, multiple calls, a visit to the branch, and still no answer. I called again to find out what is the holdup, and I was told the request was submitted to higher management and they are still waiting.  I guess they don't want my business. It's time to move on!!! I would give them zero stars if I could.",1,Connecticut,ChIJ4UqVlUAc6IkR8GD4cVLG6lw
12/15/2021 19:18:24,Sofia Valgas,This bank is unethical and terrible. The people that work there practiced discrimination on me because of my Latino accent and would not allow me to cash a check that made to my name after a showed proof of identity and then said they needed to call and confirm that it was legit because she said “I don’t know what you’re using this cash for”. My friend cashed a check the same amount next to me from the same place person and they didn’t ask any questions.,1,Connecticut,ChIJ4UqVlUAc6IkR8GD4cVLG6lw
10/23/2020 20:35:53,my online email,"I have been making monthly deposits to my mother's account at Webster Bank on Connecticut Ave. in Norwalk, CT, for years (well predating Covid).    I do not have an account there and I prefer the drive through. I write a check with the account number in the memo margin and ""deposit only"" endorsement.  Some of the time there was a need to explain a second time but if, they spoke and understood the English language it was always understood and they were totally accommodating.  Until my last two deposits, all transactions were professional.  Then I had the misfortune of dealing with Mirtha.

I do not want to say that she is lazy but given the total refusal and lack of ability to explain why she could not fill out the deposit slip (despite every other employee doing so), it is difficult to conclude otherwise.

Second only to her obvious lack of comprehension of what was being asked of her, was her complete disregard for minimizing contaminating  contact DURING A PANDEMIC.  I questioned her a couple times believing she does not comprehend what I am saying but clearly she did not care.  Even after I said I hope I do not cough on the pen, check, and of course the deposit slip that anyone can fill out because it does not require a signature, she still insisted I fill it out for her.

Also, it is clear that the very last thought in Mirtha's head is expediting on behalf of the other Webster customer's convenience.

She was like I'm not going to  do this with you if you want you could  leave then her manager asked me to leave all because i asked her a question  and  refuted her false answer and stall tactic.

07/08/2022 02:52:33,Imtiaz Bukhari,"This is the best branch of any bank I've ever seen. Love the staff. Thomas Wren is one of the best bank manager. Very hands on, doesn't like to hide behind the computer screen. You will see him on the floor very often. I love his managing style. Destine is another one who you can count on. Little quiet but knows his stuff. All other staff members are also great. I just don't know their names. One of the assistant manager who moved to park street branch was really helpful.

Final verdict: if you bank with this branch, you would not go to any other bank and I can guarantee that",5,Connecticut,ChIJa6kSkGRT5okRT_gGt2cLkoA

10/30/2023 19:06:52,Amy Stanis,"I usually only bank at Credit Unions, but my husband has an account here and insisted this is where we open our joint account.

Went into lobby, there were 2 tellers and only 2 people ahead of us.  So we did not wait long to be helped.  The teller started our transaction, took our id’s and some information.  All was well until a line of about 4 arrived behind us.  The teller stopped what she was doing and said “ I’m going to need you guys to have a seat and wait for the manager to take you into his office. I can’t have only 1 teller open right now”.  Note. There was a woman being helped by another teller and was taking a long time as well. She was not asked to go have a seat.

We sat for about 10 minutes. We waited until the last person in line was helped. We approached her and asked how much longer until the manager could see us.  She phoned into him and was told 10 mins.  Another note.  Now that all the customers in line were attended to, why could she not help us?  So we told her we would need to come back.

But honestly, if they are willing to let a new account just walk out the door, I don’t have much hope for future customer service.   Will certainly not be opening an account with them.",1,Connecticut,ChIJH8Xw2ZiY54kRzoIJsnl4m-Q

They have a teller who wants to do everything very quickly and does not listen to you, they could not solve my problem and my doubts about a transaction that appeared in my account. As a client of more than 17 years I was surprised that the branch could not solve my problem and they told me that the telephone assistants have more power than them and they left me waiting for more than 15 minutes on a phone call that never came through. Why have a branch opened by Webster Bank spending on tellers and managers if the only thing they can do is make deposits and withdraw money when that can be done through the ATM.

I'm not sure if other banks do the same.  They tried to market me on converting these IRA's to more risky non-insured investments.  I listened to their pitch & went home & Googled the info, turns out lots of people have been ""had"" by these Ponzi scheme type investments (something about ""betting the market won't drop by more than 5% or 10% in any 3 month period"").

I noticed an unauthorized deposit was made on my account, and I'm fully aware that mistakes can happen and understand that, but they should be more careful when depositing money into accounts. They should do client verification before allowing such to occur. I've been calling so many times to have them remove this unauthorized deposit that I'm unaware of (I asked everyone I knew and mind you this is a pretty new account, so no one but my family knows about this account, and they all said they have no idea who would make this deposit.) It's been incredibly inefficient to get a hold of ANYONE and every time I reach a representative, I get cut off. They're pretty rude too when you try to explain the situation. They need to get better security, better staff, better verification methods especially where you make a deposit/withdrawals. I cannot believe the audacity this bank has to act the way they do - I know jobs can be demanding, but at least maintain a level of professionalism and treat your clients with respect and maybe the ratings won't be as bad. I've been banking with this bank before it changed to Sterling National Bank (when it was Astoria Bank), and while some features improved, their mistakes have not. This has not happened only once.

They joined a good Astoria Bank, forced their Sterling name on the joint bank, forced the GOOD PEOPLE in the branches that had been Astoria to suffer 9 months of hell - and all customers with them. I am leaving this bank from hell!",1,Maryland,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
08/24/2019 13:16:19,workspace,"This place is a circus. Worst bank I've ever been to. They are slow. They operate like its the 60s. Their lines are long. And even when the lines are short, you will still wait in line for at least 15-30min. Ever since they switched to Sterling from Astoria, you can no longer open an account online and forced to go inside a branch and deal with their lousy staff like this is 1982 or something.

I've already had an account for over 3 years and I went there to open a second checking account. Instead of getting that done, I got interrogated by some old lady who asked a million questions about what the account was for, why did I call customer service on such and such a day, where did I work, what kind of work do I do, where did I open my existing account (was this a joke?) and all these weird questions that had nothing to do with opening an account and that I'm sure the answers were on her screen if she looked at my account. I've already been a member for years so why is this necessary! I sensed that the lady was just trying to do the most and waste my time because she was being racist. She even pulled out a second pen like she didn't want to touch the first pen she gave me. After asking all these unnecessary questions, which I'm sure she doesn't ask these same irrelevant questions to every person who comes in there to open an account, she then says she has to ask her manager about opening the account. I'm sorry, but did I step into the 70s? Asking your manager seriously? Are ALL your customers only allowed to open one bank account with you? Then after waiting, she comes back and says her manager will call me back. What???

And it doesn't end there. After I waited forever to speak to her for her to waste my time, I said I also wanted to make a cash deposit into my existing checking. She doesn't do that. She tells me to go wait in the bank line. I've already been waiting on you for 45 minutes for a checking account you didn't open. Why do I need to spend another eon in the bank line? Why can't you do it? So I go into the bank line, get to the teller, hand him the deposit slip and he says ""What is this?"". Are you kidding me? IT'S A DEPOSIT SLIP MORON I'M MAKING A DEPOSIT!! REALLY?

So here I am. 2 days later writing a negative review because the ""manager"" hasn't called me back, which I knew they weren't in the first place. I doubt she even spoke to her ""manager"" and probably went on a smoke break. I highly doubt a manager can't make a simple decision if an existing 3.5 year old customer, with no NSF's or bounced checks and has the cash in their hand to deposit, should open a basic checking account. So that means I have to go back again to get it done.

This branch is stupid. I only bank here because it's close should I need to go inside the branch. I mostly online bank and my experience with these clowns is THE reason why I only online bank. I have no patience for my time to be wasted dealing with people who want to throw a monkeywrench in my day, just because. I just want to open the checking account so I don't have to go back in there. Ever. They need to bring back the ability to open accounts online so the public shouldn't be forced to deal with the staff's incompetence. They're a bunch of clowns.",1,Maryland,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

09/05/2018 13:41:37,Louie Rinaldi,This is my first official 1 Star review but it I would give this bank ZERO stars if it were possible. I have been banking at this location since the 80's when it was Greater Bank. Once the bank turned into Astoria Federal savings it all went down hill from there. There were always people standing behind the glass laughing and not working while there is always a line of people I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them through the glass or what. The bank then turned to Sterling and the same issues still persist. Last night I arrived at the bank at 4:01pm and waited in line until 5:15pm to handle my 3 minute withdrawal transaction. There were only 3 tellers and the line that is supposed to be designated for businesses had a whole bunch of people who may or may not have owned businesses but really how could I know. There were literally 25 people in line and each of the other tellers were taking so much time with the customers. One man must have performed 18 transactions at one window. It was truly insane that even the security guard started helping elderly people with their transactions. I closed my savings account there a few months ago when one of the tellers was less than helpful and I am thinking of removing my other accounts here as this bank and its employees are less than helpful and pretty much useless.,1,Maryland,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

While closing my account at this location their customer ""support"" person told me to wait five minutes and after 45 min when I asked what the problem is I was told by the support person that she's done and can't help and that we should try to find a supervisor. There's literally only 3 employees in here. This is terrible.  Do not use this bank and if you have patience then close your account asap. The support persons name is Raisa, she seems old and motherly but she's actually terrible.",1,Maryland,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

For standard transactions that can be done online at many other institutions, including account opening and sending wires, you have to go into a Webster branch to complete them. You would think that they would try to compensate for their lack of technology by offering great customer service but nope. I needed to process a time sensitive transaction on my Webster account back to my Webster account and the manager wouldn’t escalate it b/c I’m a new checking client, despite being an affiliated credit client for years. Her complete disregard was a sure fire way to guarantee that I will not become an old client of the bank. This branch is surrounded by national banks with a much better offering.

12/02/2022 20:40:27,Thelma Stefanidis,"This review is for Kosta (Costa), a teller at Webster Bank on Ditmars in Astoria.  I do not bank at this branch, but today I was in Astoria and went to the teller to make a transaction.  When I walked up to the window, I was greeted with a full smile by a young man.  He saw my name on the transaction slip and spoke to me in Greek, not losing that great smile.  I then asked him if I can use the lady’s room and he escorted me to it and waited for me.

03/24/2022 20:02:46,Candice L,"AVOID AVOID AVOID.

I've sat through this bank when it was Astoria Federal, then became Sterling, and now Webster. It's incomprehensible how poor service has gotten. I'm not referring to the tellers - they have always been nice, even when the line is 30 people deep.  It's the bank policies and how it's run.

100% of my interactions for the past years have been infuriating. Each time, they ask for feedback, but it all falls on deaf ears. For example, I've tried to change my address multiple times. They take my ID with my current address and it's never completed. Most recently they took my ID, and now tell me I MUST provide my occupation and employer's name to do so?? When probed why they need this information, it's generally ""the bank wants to know"". You don't need marketing information.  I declined, and so my ""request"" was denied. Can you imagine requesting to update your own information? So my mail will go to an address I no longer live at..... and during these conversations, the tone is that it's my own fault.

What is my own fault is not leaving this bank sooner. I closed my one account this Saturday. So obviously, someone call me today with sign on bonuses for adding direct deposit, etc.  Not sure why they can't treat CURRENT customers with the same regard

Please folks, avoid this bank. It's obviously unstable, they're losing customers left and right, and making your life difficult. Trust me (and the others who also left reviews)",1,Maryland,ChIJ53MScj9fwokRJV5eW287osk

I went today to withdraw money from my account and a White older lady with short hair and glasses saw my account and requested one of the answers of the security questions to my account.  I had already given her my government ID.  I refused to give any of the answers to my security questions.  I was the only HISPANIC customer on the line and did not hear her ask such question to other people.  The service provided here is GARBAGE!!  The lady was completely RACIST.  I was the only Hispanic being questioned about my account.  The people who were in front of me were clearly White and she NEVER questioned or requested the answers to the security questions of their account.

And my question to the manager was well if you have such a strict and pretty much unheard of policy with cars being parked in the lot - wouldn’t you advise your customers???

12/17/2018 14:46:02,Tam,"Not a review of this branch per se, but of this institution as a whole.
Absolutely horrendous since the transition occurred where Astoria Federal savings became Sterling National bank. They’ve been nothing but subpar in their services. They have changed my account type without my consent, which I had to go in to change back. Then they started charging me $10 A MONTH for a printed statement even though I had already signed up for paperless statements. What’s worse is that a few months ago, they had even sent a letter in the mail saying that they would be waiving the $10 fee for all customers until March 2019. So why on earth was I getting charged every month— October, November and now December too. Every single time I have to take time out of my day to call their customer service number where I’m put on hold for about 15 mins or more. Then I have to explain how I never wanted a paper statement and so why am I getting charged $10?? Not only that but because this keeps recurring I have to constantly monitor my account to see if they are stealing my money. This month is the third time I am dealing with this even after I spoke to the representative the last time and was informed by person that I would no longer have this issue. Furthermore, I had also received a call from a representative from this local Sterling branch just about a week ago where she asked me if I had any concerns. I had told her about this recurring nuisance of an issue and she told me that it wouldn’t happen again. I am beyond annoyed by the fact that I have to police my own bank account and watch out for the bank stealing my money every month. How on earth is one paper statement even worth $10?? I’m sure the cost that printout and mailing wouldn’t possibly exceed $1. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am sick of having to constantly be on alert and then waste my time being on hold on the phone and then explain the issue over and over again every time. This time I called they didn’t even take care of the issue and put me on hold for 15 mins again and at the end of that the rep told me she would call me back to “try” to resolve this issue. As of this moment, the issue hasn’t been taken care of at all. This is a complete joke of a bank.

Do you like long wait times on the phone only to be told they can't help you and you have to come into a branch? What about a company that takes advantage of the elderly?? Well then WEBSTER BANK is the bank for you!

My father was on a fixed income with social security and Webster bank has been charging him 18 dollars a month as a checking fee for an account with under 3000 dollars in it. After he passed he was still getting this fee and now that I have taken over the estate I can see that Webster bank has charged over 200 dollars for an account that has been sitting dormant.

They refused to refund this money as this is their CONVENICE AND SERVICE FEE. I asked to close the account over 2 weeks ago and they've still been unable to assist me in closing it. Each call to them is a song of dance and the shortest time I've had before talking to someone is about 10 minutes.

I feel sorry for anyone who is using this bank! Citizens Bank is in every grocery store and charges only 3 dollars a month for checking. Many Credit unions charge nothing!

Ligiya was professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to help me with my banking needs. She took the time to understand my financial goals and provided personalized recommendations that were tailored to my specific situation. Her communication was clear and effective, and she was always available to answer any questions I had.

I was particularly impressed with Ligiya's ability to explain complex financial concepts in a way that was easy to understand. She was patient and took the time to ensure that I was comfortable with the solutions she proposed. Her dedication to providing excellent customer service was evident throughout the entire process.

I highly recommend Ligiya and Webster Bank for anyone looking for top-notch banking services. They truly understand the meaning of customer service and go above and beyond to ensure that their clients are satisfied.

I have had nothing but warm, friendly, helpful, fast experiences, being welcomed BY FIRST NAME and expectations exceeded by nearly everyone in this branch. This rarely happens in the business world today and I wish Webster's Lexington branch model could be cloned.

It's always unfortunate, and unhelpful, when someone rates a company low (or high) and doesn't give any detail as to why. With only a handful of reviews, including a low one done illogically and other low ones done without detail, it gives a false indication of this branch's true rating.

11/21/2023 19:09:15,carlos duarte,"I have been banking with them for over 20 years and now they have a new unprofessional manager Anthony that is not fit for the job that does't care about the employees and neither the customers. The manager has no business sense and have no clue how to take care of the customers and how the money works. He is so ignorant  and has no comon sense how the business works that he is willing to loose a customer to gain $30 dollars! Nina and Suzana are great and know how to care the customers and always go extra mile to make sure the customers are happy, and that is the only reason I am staying with the bank for now. These two ladies need a better manager around them so they keep performing well.

This guy/Anthony needs to know that we don't need him and neither the Webster bank. They need us the customer! Without us he has no job, and never mind, he has the job that he is just lucky to hold that position for now.",1,Massachusetts,ChIJGyLYLpOE5IkR7GT-eOP0w6E

That wasn't good enough. Any other bank it is fine, but I need to come in, sorry I'm busy. Keep away from this bank, use a credit union, like Navigant Credit Union or any other one, these big banks are bad, no wonder they are failing, with such bad service like this.

Unfortunately I am truly sad & disappointed that it’s only got more and more not customer friendly!  Today at approximately 11 on a Wednesday went through the drive thru to deposit money in my account for my mortgage which a rarely do.  I have direct deposit.  My customer server, Skyler seemed bothered by my presence.   No greeting, just asked if I knew how much money I was giving her.  After telling her I then realized I needed to deposit more so I rang the call button which she responded by coming back to the window but no communication.  She preceded by abruptly ripping original deposit slip and making the deposit.  Came back asked if there was anything else and since she was not wearing a name tag I asked her name & thanked her.  Body language along with verbal language or lack of it, goes along way.  Definitely felt like I was annoying her and did not feel like she was there for me.

01/21/2023 19:14:00,Nora Bolcon,"sat - 1-21-23 I have just left the drive thru of this branch.  I and my husband have been customers of Webster bank for 20 years.  This is the third time I have been lectured by one of two drive thru tellers when giving my and my families - we have 6 accts here - transactions to them. Literally they complain if I ever give them more than three transactions at the drive thru.  I reminded them today that the drive thru is for the convenience of the customers not the employees - they seem to want to close this window early - I told her if my whole family came here in our 4 cars each that these transactions would likely take up both their driveups and for triple the time I am taking now which was a whole 6 mins. Including the 2 minute argument started by this rude teller.  I will now call this branch manager that if they don't fix this problem with nicer tellers I will see if the district manager is interested in fixing it.  I would just go to the nicer branch a mile away but that is inconvenient for me and I think it gives these tellers what they want which is less customers at the drive thru so less work to do.  So I will keep going to this branch and keep complaining until Webster fixes this branches problem.  Fyi it is the long term two female tellers - one Caucasian with wavy fairly long brown hair and a black haired about 30 yr old who often has hair tied back that were nasty to me all three times.  The newer blond thin male, and 40-50 yr blond-gray short haired woman and the very new African American woman in her 20s we're all exceptionally nice and helpful tellers.  I would give these last three 5 stars but you pick which teller will serve you in Saturdays at the drive thru.  I usually don't report bad cust serve reps because there can be a bad sometimes but these two are awful to me regularly and make me feel uncomfortable doing my banking the best for my schedule regularly and I am fed up with COVID excused horrid customer service boardering on abusive customer service and employees just getting away with it so it just increases everywhere you go now.  That's it - I am done my rant.",1,Massachusetts,ChIJnzlL4Fhc5IkRgqSVtjJKOgc

It used to be that you could count on the same people working there, and I knew several of them by name, now there are frequently new people.  New people would be ok if I didn't have to go through the whole getting my license out and being treated with suspicion.  The last few times that I have gone to the drive thru, I have be assaulted with the hard sell of Webster products, i.e., home equity loans, credit cards and investment services.  Today really annoyed me because after cashing my check the hard sell started up, I politely declined but that didn't stop the sales pitch. Finally I said NO!  The teller proceeded to push, ""you don't want blah blah blah?""  No I don't want blah blah blah and I don't want to be subjected to this every time I go through the drive thru!  To this the reply was "" Well then maybe you should go to the ATM instead.""  Really???  Why do you have a drive thru then???

Also one time when putting $100 in the Atm to deposit money after bank hours , the Atm ate my money , luckily I had other money but still loosing the $100 was annoying ,so I filled out an incident report the day after and they said it could take 5-10 business days but they got it resolved within 2 days .everyone that I’ve come in contact with has been very nice and helpful .

They essentially penalize customers that opt to place money in CD accounts by increasing the minimum balances required by 250%. In addition, their interest rates are far from the best in the area.

Been a customer for 17 years and it wasn't always bad but unfortunately that tide has turned. I'll be keeping my money elsewhere moving forward. I think I'll try a small bank instead of one who forgets who the customer is. If I could give them a negative star I would but instead they get 1.

03/24/2022 20:02:46,Candice L,"AVOID AVOID AVOID.

I've sat through this bank when it was Astoria Federal, then became Sterling, and now Webster. It's incomprehensible how poor service has gotten. I'm not referring to the tellers - they have always been nice, even when the line is 30 people deep.  It's the bank policies and how it's run.

100% of my interactions for the past years have been infuriating. Each time, they ask for feedback, but it all falls on deaf ears. For example, I've tried to change my address multiple times. They take my ID with my current address and it's never completed. Most recently they took my ID, and now tell me I MUST provide my occupation and employer's name to do so?? When probed why they need this information, it's generally ""the bank wants to know"". You don't need marketing information.  I declined, and so my ""request"" was denied. Can you imagine requesting to update your own information? So my mail will go to an address I no longer live at..... and during these conversations, the tone is that it's my own fault.

What is my own fault is not leaving this bank sooner. I closed my one account this Saturday. So obviously, someone call me today with sign on bonuses for adding direct deposit, etc.  Not sure why they can't treat CURRENT customers with the same regard

Please folks, avoid this bank. It's obviously unstable, they're losing customers left and right, and making your life difficult. Trust me (and the others who also left reviews)",1,Montana,ChIJ53MScj9fwokRJV5eW287osk

What a Mickey Mouse operation and no offense to Mickey Mouse. I understand that there is a pandemic going on but the phones have always been working.

I went today to withdraw money from my account and a White older lady with short hair and glasses saw my account and requested one of the answers of the security questions to my account.  I had already given her my government ID.  I refused to give any of the answers to my security questions.  I was the only HISPANIC customer on the line and did not hear her ask such question to other people.  The service provided here is GARBAGE!!  The lady was completely RACIST.  I was the only Hispanic being questioned about my account.  The people who were in front of me were clearly White and she NEVER questioned or requested the answers to the security questions of their account.

Ever since they took over Astoria Federal, they have been terrible. Sterling did not know how to properly handle passbook accounts. They are a commercial bank and were not prepared at all when they went live.  A large percentage of their customers have passbook savings accounts and now they have to go to Ditmars Blvd. to do their banking.  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.

They wanto your ID just to make a transaction, such as a deposit which they may consider large. By law a large deposit is over 10K.
Having a picture in their computer system lets them compare customers to FBI, police records, etc. with the assumption that customers are crooks.  That idea is highly insulting.

05/25/2021 20:44:58,Laura Giuliano,"I think it's unfair to rate this branch as if it's the whole company. A reviewer previously rated this Lexington location with one star and clarified he was rating Webster as a whole. This totally defeats the purpose since the rating specifies this branch.

I have had nothing but warm, friendly, helpful, fast experiences, being welcomed BY FIRST NAME and expectations exceeded by nearly everyone in this branch. This rarely happens in the business world today and I wish Webster's Lexington branch model could be cloned.

It's always unfortunate, and unhelpful, when someone rates a company low (or high) and doesn't give any detail as to why. With only a handful of reviews, including a low one done illogically and other low ones done without detail, it gives a false indication of this branch's true rating.

Her communication was clear and effective, and she was always available to answer any questions I had.

I was particularly impressed with Ligiya's ability to explain complex financial concepts in a way that was easy to understand. She was patient and took the time to ensure that I was comfortable with the solutions she proposed. Her dedication to providing excellent customer service was evident throughout the entire process.

I listened to their pitch & went home & Googled the info, turns out lots of people have been ""had"" by these Ponzi scheme type investments (something about ""betting the market won't drop by more than 5% or 10% in any 3 month period"").

09/15/2021 13:15:08,Tasfia Khan,"Literally the worst bank I've ever banked with. I noticed an unauthorized deposit was made on my account, and I'm fully aware that mistakes can happen and understand that, but they should be more careful when depositing money into accounts. They should do client verification before allowing such to occur. I've been calling so many times to have them remove this unauthorized deposit that I'm unaware of (I asked everyone I knew and mind you this is a pretty new account, so no one but my family knows about this account, and they all said they have no idea who would make this deposit.) It's been incredibly inefficient to get a hold of ANYONE and every time I reach a representative, I get cut off. They're pretty rude too when you try to explain the situation. They need to get better security, better staff, better verification methods especially where you make a deposit/withdrawals. I cannot believe the audacity this bank has to act the way they do - I know jobs can be demanding, but at least maintain a level of professionalism and treat your clients with respect and maybe the ratings won't be as bad. I've been banking with this bank before it changed to Sterling National Bank (when it was Astoria Bank), and while some features improved, their mistakes have not. This has not happened only once. For a bank that is trying to improve, they need to do much more to become better.",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
08/25/2022 17:57:06,Ahmed Payel,"@websterbank My wife went to the bank to get to the vault, even though she called ahead of time and told no appointment need if an emergency. but as soon as she went to the bank the two teller asked if she had an appointment and before my wife can explain why she didn’t had an appointment they both started being rude and started yelling at her for trying to explain. My wife got fed up and yelled back. Then the manager Mathew came down, and he seemed to be more understanding as she is the one my wife spoke in the phone. My wife was so irritated that, she closed the account. # Websterbank hopefully notice all the bad reviews at this location and take action. Otherwise bank will continue to lose customer at this beautiful location and give @websterbank a really bad reputation.",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/23/2022 19:38:21,Tonima. i,"I would give this place a 0. These people are so disrespectful and rude towards their costumers. It’s so difficult to have access to the safe box downstairs. These representatives make it HELL to access the box. Several times before I made appointments for myself or my mother well in advance. But when we go, they tell us there was no appointment made…..even though the representative on the phone clearly said they “wrote it in the book.” I don’t know what kind of unorganized system this is, but it needs to change. When I called to ask why the appointment wasn’t written down properly, she hung up the phone on me saying there was a “line.”  Disgusting behavior. No longer want to bank with them or have a safe box. Unreliable.",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

05/14/2022 15:27:44,Dorota M,"The rate I give this branch is below zero/negative! This branch should be closed immediately and Director Bert Matthew and his female customer service representative should be disciplined for being very rude, disrespectful behavior. Came to this branch on Friday, May 13, 2022, spent 1 hour and left without being serviced. The female customer service representative took people who came after me. BERT Matthew  got on my elderly mother's face and SCREAMED. He got on my face too. I have never been treated like this in my life at the financial institution. They are being paid for what? Being rude and disrespectful. I felt threatened! In the past I was receiving good and satisfied service with previous Astoria bank. The manager and customer service representative should be fired and not allowed to work at any bank, they have no communication skills, rude, disrespectful,  not knowledgeable. They shouldn't be around customers.",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

My elderly mother was turned away not once but twice when she went to the bank ( both times with an appointment made). When asked for names of any employees these employees said they won’t give their names out. I hope this branch closes down and they all lose their jobs they deserve it.

as  this one. It is not the fault of the local branch. The fault lies with the top management !For the terrible mess that they made for their customers they should all go to long long jail time. They joined a good Astoria Bank, forced their Sterling name on the joint bank, forced the GOOD PEOPLE in the branches that had been Astoria to suffer 9 months of hell - and all customers with them. I am leaving this bank from hell!",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
08/24/2019 13:16:19,workspace,"This place is a circus. Worst bank I've ever been to. They are slow. They operate like its the 60s. Their lines are long. And even when the lines are short, you will still wait in line for at least 15-30min. Ever since they switched to Sterling from Astoria, you can no longer open an account online and forced to go inside a branch and deal with their lousy staff like this is 1982 or something.

I've already had an account for over 3 years and I went there to open a second checking account. Instead of getting that done, I got interrogated by some old lady who asked a million questions about what the account was for, why did I call customer service on such and such a day, where did I work, what kind of work do I do, where did I open my existing account (was this a joke?) and all these weird questions that had nothing to do with opening an account and that I'm sure the answers were on her screen if she looked at my account. I've already been a member for years so why is this necessary! I sensed that the lady was just trying to do the most and waste my time because she was being racist. She even pulled out a second pen like she didn't want to touch the first pen she gave me. After asking all these unnecessary questions, which I'm sure she doesn't ask these same irrelevant questions to every person who comes in there to open an account, she then says she has to ask her manager about opening the account. I'm sorry, but did I step into the 70s? Asking your manager seriously? Are ALL your customers only allowed to open one bank account with you? Then after waiting, she comes back and says her manager will call me back. What???

And it doesn't end there. After I waited forever to speak to her for her to waste my time, I said I also wanted to make a cash deposit into my existing checking. She doesn't do that. She tells me to go wait in the bank line. I've already been waiting on you for 45 minutes for a checking account you didn't open. Why do I need to spend another eon in the bank line? Why can't you do it? So I go into the bank line, get to the teller, hand him the deposit slip and he says ""What is this?"". Are you kidding me? IT'S A DEPOSIT SLIP MORON I'M MAKING A DEPOSIT!! REALLY?

So here I am. 2 days later writing a negative review because the ""manager"" hasn't called me back, which I knew they weren't in the first place. I doubt she even spoke to her ""manager"" and probably went on a smoke break. I highly doubt a manager can't make a simple decision if an existing 3.5 year old customer, with no NSF's or bounced checks and has the cash in their hand to deposit, should open a basic checking account. So that means I have to go back again to get it done.

This branch is stupid. I only bank here because it's close should I need to go inside the branch. I mostly online bank and my experience with these clowns is THE reason why I only online bank. I have no patience for my time to be wasted dealing with people who want to throw a monkeywrench in my day, just because. I just want to open the checking account so I don't have to go back in there. Ever. They need to bring back the ability to open accounts online so the public shouldn't be forced to deal with the staff's incompetence. They're a bunch of clowns.",1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/03/2018 23:25:01,Mohammed Alauddin,"Worst bank ever!!!! The most stupid staff members!!! Really Rude on the phone!!!(I called on 08/31/2018 at 4.28pm to get help about my debid Card, the girl didn’t help me and were so rude It’s a total mess!!!)
I wish I could give “zero”, but no options.
Recent changes and policies are really awful, not helpful. I feel like I want close this account and  go to another bank right away.  Most importantly the staff members also not cooperating and they blame the new system changes. And soon I’m going to another bank.

In the line , it takes so long to get the required services. Even up stairs also not much helpful!! They blame new systems. If the new system makes problem, they should be able to help manually!!!

09/05/2018 13:41:37,Louie Rinaldi,This is my first official 1 Star review but it I would give this bank ZERO stars if it were possible. I have been banking at this location since the 80's when it was Greater Bank. Once the bank turned into Astoria Federal savings it all went down hill from there. There were always people standing behind the glass laughing and not working while there is always a line of people I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them through the glass or what. The bank then turned to Sterling and the same issues still persist. Last night I arrived at the bank at 4:01pm and waited in line until 5:15pm to handle my 3 minute withdrawal transaction. There were only 3 tellers and the line that is supposed to be designated for businesses had a whole bunch of people who may or may not have owned businesses but really how could I know. There were literally 25 people in line and each of the other tellers were taking so much time with the customers. One man must have performed 18 transactions at one window. It was truly insane that even the security guard started helping elderly people with their transactions. I closed my savings account there a few months ago when one of the tellers was less than helpful and I am thinking of removing my other accounts here as this bank and its employees are less than helpful and pretty much useless.,1,New Jersey,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/24/2021 15:10:42,S Patricia,Worst customer service ever!!! Starting from manager to tellers.  Went in to open a bank account and access my safe deposit and was ignored.

Now I'm finally closing my account. While closing my account at this location their customer ""support"" person told me to wait five minutes and after 45 min when I asked what the problem is I was told by the support person that she's done and can't help and that we should try to find a supervisor. There's literally only 3 employees in here. This is terrible.  Do not use this bank and if you have patience then close your account asap.

The banker needed MY bill for another client. She proceed to throw loads of attitude at me, and it was very much unpleasant.

I speak with an individual who says i was “in” the bank. So what you’re saying is a customer of yours can’t grab a cup of coffee before i head out? After i was clearly inside your bank. And my question to the manager was well if you have such a strict and pretty much unheard of policy with cars being parked in the lot - wouldn’t you advise your customers??? Customers who come inside your branch?? His response was that it was too personal a question to ask.

When I Deposit Cash The tellers refuse to give me my balance. So I never know by sure how much money I had on my account. The I made payments on line and the freaking bank rebounded my payments even I have enough funds on my account. And the bank charge me $35 per every item. I’ve been losing money with Sterling so I’m gonna close my account and open a td bank account. I remember ounce I was Depositing Cash on 2 accounts and a nasty teller yelled at me for no reason.

12/17/2018 14:46:02,Tam,"Not a review of this branch per se, but of this institution as a whole.
Absolutely horrendous since the transition occurred where Astoria Federal savings became Sterling National bank. They’ve been nothing but subpar in their services. They have changed my account type without my consent, which I had to go in to change back. Then they started charging me $10 A MONTH for a printed statement even though I had already signed up for paperless statements. What’s worse is that a few months ago, they had even sent a letter in the mail saying that they would be waiving the $10 fee for all customers until March 2019. So why on earth was I getting charged every month— October, November and now December too. Every single time I have to take time out of my day to call their customer service number where I’m put on hold for about 15 mins or more. Then I have to explain how I never wanted a paper statement and so why am I getting charged $10?? Not only that but because this keeps recurring I have to constantly monitor my account to see if they are stealing my money. This month is the third time I am dealing with this even after I spoke to the representative the last time and was informed by person that I would no longer have this issue. Furthermore, I had also received a call from a representative from this local Sterling branch just about a week ago where she asked me if I had any concerns. I had told her about this recurring nuisance of an issue and she told me that it wouldn’t happen again. I am beyond annoyed by the fact that I have to police my own bank account and watch out for the bank stealing my money every month. How on earth is one paper statement even worth $10?? I’m sure the cost that printout and mailing wouldn’t possibly exceed $1. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am sick of having to constantly be on alert and then waste my time being on hold on the phone and then explain the issue over and over again every time. This time I called they didn’t even take care of the issue and put me on hold for 15 mins again and at the end of that the rep told me she would call me back to “try” to resolve this issue. As of this moment, the issue hasn’t been taken care of at all. This is a complete joke of a bank. I will be taking my business over to TD bank or elsewhere if this not resolved.",1,New Jersey,ChIJeVC2zQZfwokRwY4aHO78IcQ

В начале процесса мы столкнулись с рядом проблем во взаимодействии с управляющим банка. К сожалению, возникли недопонимания, которые привели к необходимости вызова полиции для разрешения ситуации. Этот момент был достаточно стрессовым и добавил сложностей в уже непростую процедуру.

Тем не менее, хочу выразить благодарность управляющей за то, что в итоге она смогла профессионально выполнить свою работу. После всех препятствий и разъяснения ситуации, она проявила компетентность и помогла нам получить доступ к ячейке, строго следуя предписаниям суда.

Я ценю, что, несмотря на все начальные трудности, задача была выполнена, и мы смогли завершить необходимые процедуры. Это было важно для нашей семьи, и я благодарен за профессионализм, проявленный в конечном итоге.

03/24/2022 20:02:46,Candice L,"AVOID AVOID AVOID.

I've sat through this bank when it was Astoria Federal, then became Sterling, and now Webster. It's incomprehensible how poor service has gotten. I'm not referring to the tellers - they have always been nice, even when the line is 30 people deep.  It's the bank policies and how it's run.

100% of my interactions for the past years have been infuriating. Each time, they ask for feedback, but it all falls on deaf ears. For example, I've tried to change my address multiple times. They take my ID with my current address and it's never completed. Most recently they took my ID, and now tell me I MUST provide my occupation and employer's name to do so?? When probed why they need this information, it's generally ""the bank wants to know"". You don't need marketing information.  I declined, and so my ""request"" was denied. Can you imagine requesting to update your own information? So my mail will go to an address I no longer live at..... and during these conversations, the tone is that it's my own fault.

What is my own fault is not leaving this bank sooner. I closed my one account this Saturday. So obviously, someone call me today with sign on bonuses for adding direct deposit, etc.  Not sure why they can't treat CURRENT customers with the same regard

Please folks, avoid this bank. It's obviously unstable, they're losing customers left and right, and making your life difficult. Trust me (and the others who also left reviews)",1,New Jersey,ChIJ53MScj9fwokRJV5eW287osk

I had already given her my government ID.  I refused to give any of the answers to my security questions.  I was the only HISPANIC customer on the line and did not hear her ask such question to other people.  The service provided here is GARBAGE!!  The lady was completely RACIST.

They wanto your ID just to make a transaction, such as a deposit which they may consider large. By law a large deposit is over 10K.
Having a picture in their computer system lets them compare customers to FBI, police records, etc. with the assumption that customers are crooks.  That idea is highly insulting.

Because of her and the other delightful staff at Webster Bank in Yonkers, NY at 2143 Central Ave, I will only do my banking here. Forget about Chase, TD Bank and other banks. These 2 in particular I have had some of the most awful experiences known to banking. Do yourself a favor and move your personal and business banking to Webster.

I don’t mind the wait, banks are known, like the DMV, to be sometimes tedious affairs, they just weren’t using all the people they could have. I have a 2 instead of a 1 due to having a good experience the last time. Even though they have four people behind the counter, they stubbornly kept only two counters open. This was not COVID safe.

Not only does it have an attached parking lot with plenty of parking space, but the bank itself is nicely situated in a very busy neighborhood. I dread the thought of going to another branch because I know I will never find parking but that’s never the issue here. The staff here is extremely friendly. I go to this branch for deposits and withdrawals at least 3 times a week and I have always noticed that the staff greets the customers with a smile. Then, when you get up to the teller, they actually know what they are doing and they’re quick. I have also noticed that the branch manager is always around and pays particular attention to the customers. Sure I have seen the line getting long at the branch but that usually happens right after the major holidays. Otherwise, I am usually in and out in less than 5 minutes. I have also noticed that this particular branch actually cares about its customers and remembers them by names and faces. For me, this gives me an extra level of comfort knowing that I’m in good hands. I am not leaving this branch and will continue to bring them business.

01/14/2020 22:11:51,Rashri S,"I strongly believe this bank is involved with fraud. I have never felt so disrespected and mistreated by any other entity in my life. Karina Vardanyan and Lyudmila Peygumbari are the most unprofessional, condescending, repugnant individuals I have ever encountered.

I had an account for over 10 years and requested to close the account and receive cash. I asked about the process and Lyudmila told me I needed to sign a cash release form. She e-mailed it to me and I responded with an inquiry of why I had to sign it before I received the cash or a date to retrieve my own funds. After 2 days, no one responded so I decided to call the 800 number. After explaining to Debbie (the call center manager) that I did not feel comfortable releasing the cash with no explanation because someone could easily come into the bank and pretend to be me and steal the funds. Debbie called the bank and told me that Karina placed a request for the funds through security.

Karina called me a few days later with some security questions. When I told her I was unemployed she said ""Oh, so you're a housewife,"" in a matter of fact judgmental tone. I responded that I was not a housewife and I was single. With an attitude she said ""Those are not the answers security wants to hear"". As if I should be lying about my status. I asked her why the bank would not help me with the process of receiving my own money in frustration and she transferred me to Lyudmila who insisted that I had to sign the form, yelled that she does not work for Debbie (when I told her Debbie confirmed I did not need to sign until the time of the transaction), she had other clients to attend to and when I raised my voice to say ""I am a client"", she hung up on me. The bank then ignored all 12 of my phone calls.

I called the 800 number hoping for help. I was in tears as I explained to Indira how they spoke and treated me. Indira called the bank and told me Karina would push the request to security. I truly appreciated Indira's kindness. She then transferred me to Karina and I even apologized for raising my voice. Neither Karina Vardanyan nor Lyudmila Peygumbari apologized for their disrespect and unprofessional behavior. I also never heard back from them regarding this matter.

In the end, I went to a Queens location and closed my account in a different way. I will never work with this bank again and I encourage others not to as well. This level of customer service is the worst I ever experienced. I am appalled and disgusted that Sterling National Bank allows their employees to treat their customers this way.",1,New Jersey,ChIJhcQ_7tNEwokRya3mw_mbh7A

How do you not know if a Certified Bank Check that you just wrote is or isn't legitimate?!?! The professional answer would have been yes or no.

Be prepared for 60+ minute hold times. If you are lucky enough to get a call back be prepared to be hung up on if you dare to ask a question or imply that the customer help person is wrong. The amusing part is that the automated operator asks you to stay on the line after your call to take a survey.

01/27/2023 23:14:01,John Ross,"Dear Webster Bank,
I am writing to formally complain about the service I received from one of your bank tellers, Kathleen, who works at the 35 east grassy sprain road. Yonkers Branch, on Saturday, January 14, 2023 at 10:14 a.m. I was trying to address a transaction problem that had caused a banking issue in which fees from the bank started to accumulate unbeknownst to my knowledge.

During the phone call, Kathleen made condescending comments and insults towards me. She stated that I should be grateful for any assistance provided, and that any help in this matter is rare. Furthermore, she said that since my last deposit was a few months ago, my account should be in collections for this kind of problem.

I was extremely disappointed and offended by this behavior, as it was completely unprofessional and completely unacceptable.

I expect a higher level of customer service from your employees, and this experience has left me feeling disrespected and frustrated.

Due to this negative experience, I no longer wish to continue conducting business with this institution. I would like to request an immediate and thorough investigation into this matter, and for appropriate action to be taken against Kathleen who serviced the call. I would also appreciate an apology from the bank for the manner in which I was treated.

I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that this kind of behavior does not happen again in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely, Mr. Ross",1,New Jersey,ChIJtWwXxTftwokRd5wqUd5rjeo

This is a person who clearly should not be forward-facing with clients as her “people skills” are pretty appalling. I thought maybe she was having a bad day and wanted to take it out on a customer, but I found out my parents had issues with her months earlier, so maybe she’s having a bad life? In any case, we’re all going to find a new bank. Kathleen had quite an attitude and was unprofessional, condescending, and disrespectful. I’ve never had such a bad experience at a bank before; usually bank people have great customer service, but maybe she missed that training? The bank is probably fine if you’re just going for normal transactions, but avoid dealing with this person at all costs.",2,New Jersey,ChIJtWwXxTftwokRd5wqUd5rjeo

I am a new business owner and was excited to have my daughter with me smiles galore until I was asked where was I from when I gave her my address I was told there was a closer branch there ..when I expressed that that was no worry.. the distance it was fine.. I was asked what brought me to this area? why would I need to come this far ?…when my face showed my outrage I was told oh I was just thinking about why would you wanna travel such a distance ..”this was out of concern for me”..

Meanwhile, I waited for the other teller to finish. As soon as she finished, I approached her for my cash deposit and she said, ""This is only for business you are not supposed to be here."" REALLY??? Depositing a CUSTOMER'S MONEY IS NOT A BUSINESS? WHAT IF I PULLED OUT ALL MY MONEY FROM YOUR BANK BECAUSE OF YOUR STUPID CUSTOMER SERVICE? SO WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF DEPOSIT SLIP IF IT'S NOT MEANT FOR BUSINESS??? So just like that without even entertaining me first because the LINE IS ALREADY PILLING UP.

I was fine with this, and I asked for 20 dollar bills, but she said no, and proceeded to say that she needed that bill for her customer. I was honestly shocked. The banker needed MY bill for another client. She proceed to throw loads of attitude at me, and it was very much unpleasant. Even though I gave her multiple options, she still refused and started to argue with me. This is one of the most disgusting environments ever, the employees there are horrible and very hostile.

07/20/2018 19:17:02,Kathline Vasquez,I went in here to open an account. I was there about 15-20 minutes. My car was in the parking lot. I came out and decided I’d grab a cup of coffee before i went back in my car. I wasn’t gone more than 5 minutes when i come back i see they are starting to tow my car. I speak with an individual who says i was “in” the bank. So what you’re saying is a customer of yours can’t grab a cup of coffee before i head out? After i was clearly inside your bank. And my question to the manager was well if you have such a strict and pretty much unheard of policy with cars being parked in the lot - wouldn’t you advise your customers??? Customers who come inside your branch?? His response was that it was too personal a question to ask.

When I Deposit Cash The tellers refuse to give me my balance. So I never know by sure how much money I had on my account. The I made payments on line and the freaking bank rebounded my payments even I have enough funds on my account. And the bank charge me $35 per every item. I’ve been losing money with Sterling so I’m gonna close my account and open a td bank account. I remember ounce I was Depositing Cash on 2 accounts and a nasty teller yelled at me for no reason. Please make your self a favor by staining away from these suckers.,1,New York,ChIJeVC2zQZfwokRwY4aHO78IcQ
12/17/2018 14:46:02,Tam,"Not a review of this branch per se, but of this institution as a whole.
Absolutely horrendous since the transition occurred where Astoria Federal savings became Sterling National bank. They’ve been nothing but subpar in their services. They have changed my account type without my consent, which I had to go in to change back. Then they started charging me $10 A MONTH for a printed statement even though I had already signed up for paperless statements. What’s worse is that a few months ago, they had even sent a letter in the mail saying that they would be waiving the $10 fee for all customers until March 2019. So why on earth was I getting charged every month— October, November and now December too. Every single time I have to take time out of my day to call their customer service number where I’m put on hold for about 15 mins or more. Then I have to explain how I never wanted a paper statement and so why am I getting charged $10?? Not only that but because this keeps recurring I have to constantly monitor my account to see if they are stealing my money. This month is the third time I am dealing with this even after I spoke to the representative the last time and was informed by person that I would no longer have this issue. Furthermore, I had also received a call from a representative from this local Sterling branch just about a week ago where she asked me if I had any concerns. I had told her about this recurring nuisance of an issue and she told me that it wouldn’t happen again. I am beyond annoyed by the fact that I have to police my own bank account and watch out for the bank stealing my money every month. How on earth is one paper statement even worth $10?? I’m sure the cost that printout and mailing wouldn’t possibly exceed $1. This is absolutely ridiculous. I am sick of having to constantly be on alert and then waste my time being on hold on the phone and then explain the issue over and over again every time. This time I called they didn’t even take care of the issue and put me on hold for 15 mins again and at the end of that the rep told me she would call me back to “try” to resolve this issue. As of this moment, the issue hasn’t been taken care of at all. This is a complete joke of a bank. I will be taking my business over to TD bank or elsewhere if this not resolved.",1,New York,ChIJeVC2zQZfwokRwY4aHO78IcQ

While my friend was using the atm she walked in and was watching us and asked if we were together, why ask me that it was none of her business I did not answer. Mine you I don’t know she works there and was there to open the bank. Now she felt like we were taking to long and tell us to leave and come. back later who are you to tell me to leave cause you feel like I’m taking to long to do my transactions.

03/24/2022 20:02:46,Candice L,"AVOID AVOID AVOID.

I've sat through this bank when it was Astoria Federal, then became Sterling, and now Webster. It's incomprehensible how poor service has gotten. I'm not referring to the tellers - they have always been nice, even when the line is 30 people deep.  It's the bank policies and how it's run.

100% of my interactions for the past years have been infuriating. Each time, they ask for feedback, but it all falls on deaf ears. For example, I've tried to change my address multiple times. They take my ID with my current address and it's never completed. Most recently they took my ID, and now tell me I MUST provide my occupation and employer's name to do so?? When probed why they need this information, it's generally ""the bank wants to know"". You don't need marketing information.  I declined, and so my ""request"" was denied. Can you imagine requesting to update your own information? So my mail will go to an address I no longer live at..... and during these conversations, the tone is that it's my own fault.

What is my own fault is not leaving this bank sooner. I closed my one account this Saturday. So obviously, someone call me today with sign on bonuses for adding direct deposit, etc.  Not sure why they can't treat CURRENT customers with the same regard

Please folks, avoid this bank. It's obviously unstable, they're losing customers left and right, and making your life difficult. Trust me (and the others who also left reviews)",1,New York,ChIJ53MScj9fwokRJV5eW287osk

I went today to withdraw money from my account and a White older lady with short hair and glasses saw my account and requested one of the answers of the security questions to my account.  I had already given her my government ID.  I refused to give any of the answers to my security questions.  I was the only HISPANIC customer on the line and did not hear her ask such question to other people.  The service provided here is GARBAGE!!  The lady was completely RACIST.  I was the only Hispanic being questioned about my account.  The people who were in front of me were clearly White and she NEVER questioned or requested the answers to the security questions of their account.

They should do client verification before allowing such to occur. I've been calling so many times to have them remove this unauthorized deposit that I'm unaware of (I asked everyone I knew and mind you this is a pretty new account, so no one but my family knows about this account, and they all said they have no idea who would make this deposit.) It's been incredibly inefficient to get a hold of ANYONE and every time I reach a representative, I get cut off. They're pretty rude too when you try to explain the situation. They need to get better security, better staff, better verification methods especially where you make a deposit/withdrawals. I cannot believe the audacity this bank has to act the way they do - I know jobs can be demanding, but at least maintain a level of professionalism and treat your clients with respect and maybe the ratings won't be as bad. I've been banking with this bank before it changed to Sterling National Bank (when it was Astoria Bank), and while some features improved, their mistakes have not. This has not happened only once. For a bank that is trying to improve, they need to do much more to become better.",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
08/25/2022 17:57:06,Ahmed Payel,"@websterbank My wife went to the bank to get to the vault, even though she called ahead of time and told no appointment need if an emergency. but as soon as she went to the bank the two teller asked if she had an appointment and before my wife can explain why she didn’t had an appointment they both started being rude and started yelling at her for trying to explain. My wife got fed up and yelled back. Then the manager Mathew came down, and he seemed to be more understanding as she is the one my wife spoke in the phone. My wife was so irritated that, she closed the account. # Websterbank hopefully notice all the bad reviews at this location and take action. Otherwise bank will continue to lose customer at this beautiful location and give @websterbank a really bad reputation.",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/23/2022 19:38:21,Tonima. i,"I would give this place a 0. These people are so disrespectful and rude towards their costumers. It’s so difficult to have access to the safe box downstairs. These representatives make it HELL to access the box. Several times before I made appointments for myself or my mother well in advance. But when we go, they tell us there was no appointment made…..even though the representative on the phone clearly said they “wrote it in the book.” I don’t know what kind of unorganized system this is, but it needs to change. When I called to ask why the appointment wasn’t written down properly, she hung up the phone on me saying there was a “line.”  Disgusting behavior. No longer want to bank with them or have a safe box. Unreliable.",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

05/14/2022 15:27:44,Dorota M,"The rate I give this branch is below zero/negative! This branch should be closed immediately and Director Bert Matthew and his female customer service representative should be disciplined for being very rude, disrespectful behavior. Came to this branch on Friday, May 13, 2022, spent 1 hour and left without being serviced. The female customer service representative took people who came after me. BERT Matthew  got on my elderly mother's face and SCREAMED. He got on my face too. I have never been treated like this in my life at the financial institution. They are being paid for what? Being rude and disrespectful. I felt threatened! In the past I was receiving good and satisfied service with previous Astoria bank. The manager and customer service representative should be fired and not allowed to work at any bank, they have no communication skills, rude, disrespectful,  not knowledgeable. They shouldn't be around customers.",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34

My elderly mother was turned away not once but twice when she went to the bank ( both times with an appointment made).

as  this one. It is not the fault of the local branch. The fault lies with the top management !For the terrible mess that they made for their customers they should all go to long long jail time. They joined a good Astoria Bank, forced their Sterling name on the joint bank, forced the GOOD PEOPLE in the branches that had been Astoria to suffer 9 months of hell - and all customers with them. I am leaving this bank from hell!",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
08/24/2019 13:16:19,workspace,"This place is a circus. Worst bank I've ever been to. They are slow. They operate like its the 60s. Their lines are long. And even when the lines are short, you will still wait in line for at least 15-30min. Ever since they switched to Sterling from Astoria, you can no longer open an account online and forced to go inside a branch and deal with their lousy staff like this is 1982 or something.

I've already had an account for over 3 years and I went there to open a second checking account. Instead of getting that done, I got interrogated by some old lady who asked a million questions about what the account was for, why did I call customer service on such and such a day, where did I work, what kind of work do I do, where did I open my existing account (was this a joke?) and all these weird questions that had nothing to do with opening an account and that I'm sure the answers were on her screen if she looked at my account. I've already been a member for years so why is this necessary! I sensed that the lady was just trying to do the most and waste my time because she was being racist. She even pulled out a second pen like she didn't want to touch the first pen she gave me. After asking all these unnecessary questions, which I'm sure she doesn't ask these same irrelevant questions to every person who comes in there to open an account, she then says she has to ask her manager about opening the account. I'm sorry, but did I step into the 70s? Asking your manager seriously? Are ALL your customers only allowed to open one bank account with you? Then after waiting, she comes back and says her manager will call me back. What???

And it doesn't end there. After I waited forever to speak to her for her to waste my time, I said I also wanted to make a cash deposit into my existing checking. She doesn't do that. She tells me to go wait in the bank line. I've already been waiting on you for 45 minutes for a checking account you didn't open. Why do I need to spend another eon in the bank line? Why can't you do it? So I go into the bank line, get to the teller, hand him the deposit slip and he says ""What is this?"". Are you kidding me? IT'S A DEPOSIT SLIP MORON I'M MAKING A DEPOSIT!! REALLY?

So here I am. 2 days later writing a negative review because the ""manager"" hasn't called me back, which I knew they weren't in the first place. I doubt she even spoke to her ""manager"" and probably went on a smoke break. I highly doubt a manager can't make a simple decision if an existing 3.5 year old customer, with no NSF's or bounced checks and has the cash in their hand to deposit, should open a basic checking account. So that means I have to go back again to get it done.

This branch is stupid. I only bank here because it's close should I need to go inside the branch. I mostly online bank and my experience with these clowns is THE reason why I only online bank. I have no patience for my time to be wasted dealing with people who want to throw a monkeywrench in my day, just because. I just want to open the checking account so I don't have to go back in there. Ever. They need to bring back the ability to open accounts online so the public shouldn't be forced to deal with the staff's incompetence. They're a bunch of clowns.",1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/03/2018 23:25:01,Mohammed Alauddin,"Worst bank ever!!!! The most stupid staff members!!! Really Rude on the phone!!!(I called on 08/31/2018 at 4.28pm to get help about my debid Card, the girl didn’t help me and were so rude It’s a total mess!!!)
I wish I could give “zero”, but no options.
Recent changes and policies are really awful, not helpful. I feel like I want close this account and  go to another bank right away.  Most importantly the staff members also not cooperating and they blame the new system changes. And soon I’m going to another bank.

In the line , it takes so long to get the required services. Even up stairs also not much helpful!! They blame new systems. If the new system makes problem, they should be able to help manually!!!

09/05/2018 13:41:37,Louie Rinaldi,This is my first official 1 Star review but it I would give this bank ZERO stars if it were possible. I have been banking at this location since the 80's when it was Greater Bank. Once the bank turned into Astoria Federal savings it all went down hill from there. There were always people standing behind the glass laughing and not working while there is always a line of people I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them through the glass or what. The bank then turned to Sterling and the same issues still persist. Last night I arrived at the bank at 4:01pm and waited in line until 5:15pm to handle my 3 minute withdrawal transaction. There were only 3 tellers and the line that is supposed to be designated for businesses had a whole bunch of people who may or may not have owned businesses but really how could I know. There were literally 25 people in line and each of the other tellers were taking so much time with the customers. One man must have performed 18 transactions at one window. It was truly insane that even the security guard started helping elderly people with their transactions. I closed my savings account there a few months ago when one of the tellers was less than helpful and I am thinking of removing my other accounts here as this bank and its employees are less than helpful and pretty much useless.,1,New York,ChIJE7M2HSlbwokRF0VBEDVMV34
09/24/2021 15:10:42,S Patricia,Worst customer service ever!!! Starting from manager to tellers.  Went in to open a bank account and access my safe deposit and was ignored.

Now I'm finally closing my account. While closing my account at this location their customer ""support"" person told me to wait five minutes and after 45 min when I asked what the problem is I was told by the support person that she's done and can't help and that we should try to find a supervisor. There's literally only 3 employees in here. This is terrible.  Do not use this bank and if you have patience then close your account asap.

For standard transactions that can be done online at many other institutions, including account opening and sending wires, you have to go into a Webster branch to complete them. You would think that they would try to compensate for their lack of technology by offering great customer service but nope. I needed to process a time sensitive transaction on my Webster account back to my Webster account and the manager wouldn’t escalate it b/c I’m a new checking client, despite being an affiliated credit client for years. Her complete disregard was a sure fire way to guarantee that I will not become an old client of the bank. This branch is surrounded by national banks with a much better offering.

She had no clue what she was doing and kept dragging on the process because of her lack of know-how. This dragged a simple transaction into 5 days of back and forth. She was unprofessional and unsympathetic to my situation.

I do not bank at this branch, but today I was in Astoria and went to the teller to make a transaction.  When I walked up to the window, I was greeted with a full smile by a young man.  He saw my name on the transaction slip and spoke to me in Greek, not losing that great smile.  I then asked him if I can use the lady’s room and he escorted me to it and waited for me.  I was so impressed by him that I asked him for his name.  This is the kind of customer care that one expects when banking.  Unfortunately, it is very rare.  I definitely do not receive this treatment at my branch after banking there for years.  Thank you Kosta for making my day today.

A few things: clerks correct your math to your face, even when you are right and they end up being wrong; have banking technology that is years behind their competitors; constantly try to sell you banking products even when asked nicely several times not to; share your account information with others who make deposits on your behalf; are known for exceptionally long lines at their branches...they do nothing to remedy these problems.

No eye contact through the entire service and even say simple greetings like hi how are you, or have a good one. I was very offended and was so sorry for the person I support.

Apparently they sent mail  to our old address where we don’t live anymore but they could have at least called us and inform us. Yes, we didn’t get any refund because they told us it’s our mistake but the fact that they never informed us this could happened when we first opened our account with them.

Instead only two lines were open the the number of people kept increasing. Add that to the fact that they had closed of half the area, it felt a little like anti social distancing. I don’t mind the wait, banks are known, like the DMV, to be sometimes tedious affairs, they just weren’t using all the people they could have. I have a 2 instead of a 1 due to having a good experience the last time. Even though they have four people behind the counter, they stubbornly kept only two counters open. This was not COVID safe. One woman was on the counter, took one person and then started talking to the other person not working. The teller Ramesh was amazing, so I increased it to 3 stars.

11/07/2018 02:27:27,Farris Fayyaz,"I disagree with the bad reviews because I have had such a good experience banking here. This bank is such a blessing for the neighborhood. Not only does it have an attached parking lot with plenty of parking space, but the bank itself is nicely situated in a very busy neighborhood. I dread the thought of going to another branch because I know I will never find parking but that’s never the issue here. The staff here is extremely friendly. I go to this branch for deposits and withdrawals at least 3 times a week and I have always noticed that the staff greets the customers with a smile. Then, when you get up to the teller, they actually know what they are doing and they’re quick. I have also noticed that the branch manager is always around and pays particular attention to the customers. Sure I have seen the line getting long at the branch but that usually happens right after the major holidays. Otherwise, I am usually in and out in less than 5 minutes. I have also noticed that this particular branch actually cares about its customers and remembers them by names and faces. For me, this gives me an extra level of comfort knowing that I’m in good hands. I am not leaving this branch and will continue to bring them business. I see improvements every time I visit so keep up the good work and don’t let the negative (and untruthful) reviews bring your morale down.",5,New York,ChIJhcQ_7tNEwokRya3mw_mbh7A

When i ask when it will be fixed, they don't know. The lines are very long to do something that takes 5 seconds. And the last straw for me was when i walked in to make a deposit because i needed to pay something something quickly. Guess what? ""The machine is broken"". WHAT?? Im changing my bank right now. And don't get me wrong, the people here are nice (although slow) and the place looks nice but the service is terrible. This place used to be great when it was Austria bank.

01/14/2020 22:11:51,Rashri S,"I strongly believe this bank is involved with fraud. I have never felt so disrespected and mistreated by any other entity in my life. Karina Vardanyan and Lyudmila Peygumbari are the most unprofessional, condescending, repugnant individuals I have ever encountered.

I had an account for over 10 years and requested to close the account and receive cash. I asked about the process and Lyudmila told me I needed to sign a cash release form. She e-mailed it to me and I responded with an inquiry of why I had to sign it before I received the cash or a date to retrieve my own funds. After 2 days, no one responded so I decided to call the 800 number. After explaining to Debbie (the call center manager) that I did not feel comfortable releasing the cash with no explanation because someone could easily come into the bank and pretend to be me and steal the funds. Debbie called the bank and told me that Karina placed a request for the funds through security.

Karina called me a few days later with some security questions. When I told her I was unemployed she said ""Oh, so you're a housewife,"" in a matter of fact judgmental tone. I responded that I was not a housewife and I was single. With an attitude she said ""Those are not the answers security wants to hear"". As if I should be lying about my status. I asked her why the bank would not help me with the process of receiving my own money in frustration and she transferred me to Lyudmila who insisted that I had to sign the form, yelled that she does not work for Debbie (when I told her Debbie confirmed I did not need to sign until the time of the transaction), she had other clients to attend to and when I raised my voice to say ""I am a client"", she hung up on me. The bank then ignored all 12 of my phone calls.

I called the 800 number hoping for help. I was in tears as I explained to Indira how they spoke and treated me. Indira called the bank and told me Karina would push the request to security. I truly appreciated Indira's kindness. She then transferred me to Karina and I even apologized for raising my voice. Neither Karina Vardanyan nor Lyudmila Peygumbari apologized for their disrespect and unprofessional behavior. I also never heard back from them regarding this matter.

In the end, I went to a Queens location and closed my account in a different way. I will never work with this bank again and I encourage others not to as well. This level of customer service is the worst I ever experienced. I am appalled and disgusted that Sterling National Bank allows their employees to treat their customers this way.",1,New York,ChIJhcQ_7tNEwokRya3mw_mbh7A

I had a fraudulent activity  on my debit card and was told by the banks Fraud Department to get a replacement card at the Financial Center.  The bank teller Seluck Donmez was very helpful since he is new, (I assumed)  he asked Deanna Widmer for assistance. Mrs. Widmer review my account with her colleague Theresa Smith Jausenth, and told the teller not to give me a card. When I asked, why, she responded I don't have  much money in the account and there is a $10.00 fee. As a former employee, and to my knowledge the $10.00 fee is only charged when  cards are lost not for fraud.  When I informed my Widmer I was a past employee and felt discriminated against. She rush to the back officer to called the Bank Manger regarding the situations . After 20 mins of waiting she informed me the card will be issued and that it was an exception. I felt Ms. Widmer actions was very racist and only provided the proper service ,since  I  was a former employer and informed her this issues will be reported.

03/08/2024 18:04:58,Smokes Alloy,"Don't do it.  Webster/Brio will massively tie up your funds and charge you high fees for it.  Once they show ACH transfers inbound clear and funds available, if you try transferring any funds out, there are additional holds placed on the originally cleared funds, as well as the transfer holds, making your available balance negative.

Then transfers will fail due to lacking ""available"" funds, which were available at the time of transfer.  Each fee for this is $35 and they do retry failed transfers without checking if the funds are currently ""available"".

Then they will likely flag your account, request additional verification documents, and the account will be suspended for who knows how long until they get around to processing these documents.

There seems to be good potential for a class action lawsuit against this bank - Brio/Webster.",1,Ohio,ChIJC2MwDarB54kR79mpobTLShY
09/12/2023 17:40:15,Gabe Cabrera,"I have just dealt with the most incompetent Customer Service people at Webster Bank - via phone Customer Service. For almost 1 month I have called Webster’s Customer Service and have received the worse service I have ever had. The first call told me erroneous information and told me to re-set up two Bill Pays that had been “lost” since the Sterling Bank system’s conversion. Wrong! They just weren’t visible online.  I called again to correct the double debits, was told by someone who couldn’t speak good English after 30 minutes or so that she would reverse the transactions. Never done. Called back to check on the status of the reversals. I was then transferred FIVE times - the final time I was transferred to Dollar Bank!!! I have nothing to do with a Dollar Bank. The total amount that was erroneously debited from my accounts is substantial. I went to my local branch and dealt with a knowledgeable person who, hopefully, is getting my problem corrected. Webster Bank has outsourced their Customer Service responsibilities to totally incompetent people who don’t understand English and certainly can’t speak it.

06/22/2023 13:40:32,Mark Gabriel,"I've been a loyal customer of Webster Bank for a staggering 40 years. However, I need to share my recent experience over the last 10 days, which has left me incredibly disappointed and frustrated.

It all began when Webster Bank notified me 10 days ago that my card was being deactivated due to unauthorized purchases that I had not made. Naturally concerned, I immediately contacted their customer service. They assured me that a new card would be expedited and I should receive it within 3 days.

However, 5 days passed, and I still hadn't received my new card. Anxious and perplexed, I called customer service again. This time, they admitted their mistake, stating that the card had not been expedited as promised. They assured me that I would receive the card within a maximum of 2 more days. At this point, I had already gone a full week without a functioning debit card.

Day 9 arrived, and I called Webster Bank once more, only to be informed that they would expedite another card, which I should receive in another 2-3 days. It seemed like an endless cycle of broken promises.

Finally, this morning, one of the cards showed up in my mailbox. Excited to regain access to my funds, I attempted to activate it but encountered an error. Annoyed, I called the activation number provided, only to be directed to visit a Webster branch. This is where things took an unexpected turn.

Upon entering my local branch and approaching a teller, I explained that I had been issued a new card but couldn't activate it. I handed over the card and my ID as requested. To my surprise, the teller whispered something unintelligible to her colleague, and suddenly, I found myself caught up in an ""investigation"" of sorts, apparently initiated by Webster Bank.

The branch manager then astonishingly informed me that MY card, with MY name on it, was stolen. This revelation left me dumbfounded. For the next 20 minutes, we went back and forth, as I desperately tried to resolve the situation and obtain a working card. It became increasingly clear that Webster Bank had made some sort of mistake, but they were unwilling to admit fault.

Growing increasingly frustrated and humiliated, I noticed a clear path to the exit. At that moment, I made the decision that Webster Bank could keep the card. I no longer wanted any part in this ordeal. I informed the branch manager that she could keep my card and should follow up with me at my current address, as I intended to explore alternative banking options going forward.

In conclusion, my long-standing trust and loyalty to Webster Bank have been shattered. What was once a reliable and trustworthy banking option has transformed into a soulless machine that seemingly couldn't care less about its longtime customers. Webster Bank, you have truly let me down and I'm looking forward to utilizing one of your many competitors for all of my accounts.

UPDATE: it's now been 14 days and I have not heard a response from Webster bank, the branch and I still have not received my replacement card.",1,Ohio,ChIJC2MwDarB54kR79mpobTLShY

I went in with the mindset to close my account due to fraud and the long process of 7-10 business days to get a new debit card. I have called and conveyed my issues and asked what is the fastest solution to getting a new card. Others said 7-10 business days were the fastest. I went in to withdraw and close my account and Laquea was very helpful and said she could get one expedited  in 1-2 days. Her genuine concern to helpful made my reconsider staying with webster.

Using the drive-thru, the tellers are friendlier but SO SLOW. I used to work as a bank teller, and depositing a check takes all of 30 seconds. If the system is slow, they should be apologizing for it... but I really don't think that's the case for every month I'm there. A simple deposit should not take 5+ minutes.

I never had a OVERDRAFT PROTECTION set up where they charge you a overdraft fee even thou you have the money in a account that's linked to one another. Doesn't make sense to me. Why even have overdraft protection if that's the case. Oh yeah, I forgot.... So they can get an extra 10.00 out of you to transfer your money into a account.",1,Ohio,ChIJXxNCh9Hk5okROOOBuaUggH8

My credit score is near 800, DTI is under 40%, and income is more than adequate. (Again, I had JUST purchased the home and had zero problems obtaining the original mortgage and HELOC.) Once I was denied by Webster, there was no communication or ability to present my case to underwriting.

01/05/2023 18:02:34,Kennyat Kwnphoto gmail,"I am preparing to close my last account here.
Decades long customer thru many name changes and location closings.
Before my convenient local branch closed two years ago the new owners sent me many questionnaires and check lists to rate that branch with ?s like 'was I greeted with a smile?'.  I felt like a spy.  All favorable reviews from me. They closed the branch anyway and the new location was soooo much worse.
Most tellers had strong accents; that plus face masks = a real communication problem.
Two weeks ago I went there (Syosset) to close a cd.  At some point hat branch had been shut down without a word.  I walked around the building (10degreesF) to find the new address.
The new branch had one teller; while waiting my turn I walked 10 feet to check if the rear entrance worked or had parking. The teller is still with the earlier customer so I'm in no hurry. Then a newer cust enters goes right to the teller. She serves him right away totally blowing me off.  Btw the webster (or whatever they call themselves this week) cd interest rate was 0.01% compared to 4+% at rival bank. When I told the webster worker my new cd rate she said rates like that could ruin the economy... Really?  Really?   Your 0.01% interest rate cannot even buy a lollipop.
This Syosset branch is on their third manager in weeks.  Ask about that to see how fast they change the subject.
The barber shop next door gives more confidence and a lollipop.

AND do not answer with 'Response for the owner'  .... Too little too late. Treat your customer with respect before they come to close their accounts.",1,Ohio,ChIJ551oJUiCwokRqzivD24QLeU

That being said, now that they bought Sterling and updated everything, apparently their customer service also, they are absolutely horrible! They update and don't tell the customer their electronic payments may be sent out by check so the creditors will get it wells weeks later, if at all. They send it to a completely incorrect PO Box. Then when you request a copy of said check, you cannot get it instantly like other banks. I called the Warwick location, was told they always send checks, it's not electronic. He huffed and puffed then sent me to someone that couldn't help. I was laughed at, hung up on, passed around to departments that I didn't need. I spent many hours only to be told I can't get the check for over a week. Putting my payment investigation in jeopardy. I am extremely disappointed and I'm sure the really don't care.

Today at approximately 11 on a Wednesday went through the drive thru to deposit money in my account for my mortgage which a rarely do.  I have direct deposit.  My customer server, Skyler seemed bothered by my presence.   No greeting, just asked if I knew how much money I was giving her.  After telling her I then realized I needed to deposit more so I rang the call button which she responded by coming back to the window but no communication.  She preceded by abruptly ripping original deposit slip and making the deposit.  Came back asked if there was anything else and since she was not wearing a name tag I asked her name & thanked her.  Body language along with verbal language or lack of it, goes along way.  Definitely felt like I was annoying her and did not feel like she was there for me.

01/21/2023 19:14:00,Nora Bolcon,"sat - 1-21-23 I have just left the drive thru of this branch.  I and my husband have been customers of Webster bank for 20 years.  This is the third time I have been lectured by one of two drive thru tellers when giving my and my families - we have 6 accts here - transactions to them. Literally they complain if I ever give them more than three transactions at the drive thru.  I reminded them today that the drive thru is for the convenience of the customers not the employees - they seem to want to close this window early - I told her if my whole family came here in our 4 cars each that these transactions would likely take up both their driveups and for triple the time I am taking now which was a whole 6 mins. Including the 2 minute argument started by this rude teller.  I will now call this branch manager that if they don't fix this problem with nicer tellers I will see if the district manager is interested in fixing it.  I would just go to the nicer branch a mile away but that is inconvenient for me and I think it gives these tellers what they want which is less customers at the drive thru so less work to do.  So I will keep going to this branch and keep complaining until Webster fixes this branches problem.  Fyi it is the long term two female tellers - one Caucasian with wavy fairly long brown hair and a black haired about 30 yr old who often has hair tied back that were nasty to me all three times.  The newer blond thin male, and 40-50 yr blond-gray short haired woman and the very new African American woman in her 20s we're all exceptionally nice and helpful tellers.  I would give these last three 5 stars but you pick which teller will serve you in Saturdays at the drive thru.  I usually don't report bad cust serve reps because there can be a bad sometimes but these two are awful to me regularly and make me feel uncomfortable doing my banking the best for my schedule regularly and I am fed up with COVID excused horrid customer service boardering on abusive customer service and employees just getting away with it so it just increases everywhere you go now.

It used to be that you could count on the same people working there, and I knew several of them by name, now there are frequently new people.  New people would be ok if I didn't have to go through the whole getting my license out and being treated with suspicion.  The last few times that I have gone to the drive thru, I have be assaulted with the hard sell of Webster products, i.e., home equity loans, credit cards and investment services.  Today really annoyed me because after cashing my check the hard sell started up, I politely declined but that didn't stop the sales pitch. Finally I said NO!  The teller proceeded to push, ""you don't want blah blah blah?""  No I don't want blah blah blah and I don't want to be subjected to this every time I go through the drive thru!  To this the reply was "" Well then maybe you should go to the ATM instead.""  Really???  Why do you have a drive thru then???

Do you like long wait times on the phone only to be told they can't help you and you have to come into a branch? What about a company that takes advantage of the elderly?? Well then WEBSTER BANK is the bank for you!

My father was on a fixed income with social security and Webster bank has been charging him 18 dollars a month as a checking fee for an account with under 3000 dollars in it. After he passed he was still getting this fee and now that I have taken over the estate I can see that Webster bank has charged over 200 dollars for an account that has been sitting dormant.

They refused to refund this money as this is their CONVENICE AND SERVICE FEE. I asked to close the account over 2 weeks ago and they've still been unable to assist me in closing it. Each call to them is a song of dance and the shortest time I've had before talking to someone is about 10 minutes.

I feel sorry for anyone who is using this bank! Citizens Bank is in every grocery store and charges only 3 dollars a month for checking. Many Credit unions charge nothing!

I called cusomer service today & they informed me my card was never shipped. I also requested on September 28th that I would have my card express mailed for the fee that webster bank charges you (which is the scam). The support agent denied having the ability to send the new card via express mail. Well today is day #14, no card. I called today asking about an update and the agent asked me why I didnt pay for the express mail service. What!?? Now there is an option to do that? I'm so lost and confused.. The Webster Bank employees are just as incompetent as they were 2 years ago. I should have sswitched banks after the last fiasco. Horrible customer service. Poor employee training.

Went into lobby, there were 2 tellers and only 2 people ahead of us.  So we did not wait long to be helped.  The teller started our transaction, took our id’s and some information.  All was well until a line of about 4 arrived behind us.  The teller stopped what she was doing and said “ I’m going to need you guys to have a seat and wait for the manager to take you into his office. I can’t have only 1 teller open right now”.  Note. There was a woman being helped by another teller and was taking a long time as well. She was not asked to go have a seat.

We sat for about 10 minutes. We waited until the last person in line was helped. We approached her and asked how much longer until the manager could see us.

She never advised me of the banks policy and procedures regarding the matter, had no empathy for my recent loss, then because of which and my own mental illness she decided to throw me out bc I was visibly upset and raised my voice at her. The next trip was no different, went back w a court order and she still didn't do her job and inform me of anything.
The corporate office was the one who told me I had to wait 10 business days for the legal team . It's now been 14 and they again failed to do their dam job. I made a formal complaint against them and will also call the BBB. URGE YOU TO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH Them IN ANY MATTER.

Yet again 7 years later and a different branch and it was turning into arguing. Then they claimed their legal team needed to review this and thst in a few hours i would receive a call either from Austin. Never received a phone call or anything a week later and still nothing. I went with Peoples United and i am so glad that I did. They treated me nicely and were able to handle the matter. So avoid banking with Webster Bank.

But if you have private information you want to discuss in one of several offices they have empty there, you are told they are working behind the counter so you need to talk to them there, in front of everyone, so the person in line behind you can hear exactly what is your request.

07/27/2023 20:27:11,DRITAN LIRIONI,"The worst bank around the valley, and i am not saying because of some bad behavior or attitude that this branch's employees have constantly based on their heritage, but i am saying because their ignorance that characterizes all of them starting from the manager all the way to their tellers and not going to the personnel who sits at their desks assuming they are the ones who knows the most, even though they are just some of the worst of everyone there. First of all, if you dare to go and sit down with them, prepare yourself because it takes forever to finish up even the smallest procedure. if you are looking for wire transfers, forget it, they will screw you 100 times, the only one job they have on working on the numbers and checking how to do it correctly that only job they just don't see the importance of it and treat that as it would be the least important thing people have in their concerns. they never admit that it's their fault, always will blame the customer. the other day for instance, i went there sit down and did 3 international wire transfers. Unfortunately, 2 of them were done incorrectly, i was lucky to have one of them fixed because i was told from the other side that the wire hasn't arrived yet and so i took further measurement right away, unfortunately the other one no luck. it's been 10 days so far and still nothing. The unresponsible people who work there, the customer service over the phone that never picks up the phone. Guys, after almost 6 years of working with them, i am closing all mu accounts and deal i have with them.

06/22/2023 13:39:40,Mark Gabriel,"I've been a loyal customer of Webster Bank (specifically this Wethersfield location) for a staggering 40 years. However, I need to share my recent experience over the last 10 days, which has left me incredibly disappointed and frustrated.

It all began when Webster Bank notified me 10 days ago that my card was being deactivated due to unauthorized purchases that I had not made. Naturally concerned, I immediately contacted their customer service. They assured me that a new card would be expedited and I should receive it within 3 days.

However, 5 days passed, and I still hadn't received my new card. Anxious and perplexed, I called customer service again. This time, they admitted their mistake, stating that the card had not been expedited as promised. They assured me that I would receive the card within a maximum of 2 more days. At this point, I had already gone a full week without a functioning debit card.

Day 9 arrived, and I called Webster Bank once more, only to be informed that they would expedite another card, which I should receive in another 2-3 days. It seemed like an endless cycle of broken promises.

Finally, this morning, one of the cards showed up in my mailbox. Excited to regain access to my funds, I attempted to activate it but encountered an error. Annoyed, I called the activation number provided, only to be directed to visit a Webster branch. This is where things took an unexpected turn.

Upon entering the branch and approaching a teller, I explained that I had been issued a new card but couldn't activate it. I handed over the card and my ID as requested. To my surprise, the teller whispered something unintelligible to her colleague, and suddenly, I found myself caught up in an ""investigation"" of sorts, apparently initiated by Webster Bank.

The branch manager then astonishingly informed me that MY card, with MY name on it, was stolen. This revelation left me dumbfounded. For the next 20 minutes, we went back and forth, as I desperately tried to resolve the situation and obtain a working card. It became increasingly clear that Webster Bank had made some sort of mistake, but they were unwilling to admit fault.

Growing increasingly frustrated and humiliated, I noticed a clear path to the exit. At that moment, I made the decision that Webster Bank could keep the card. I no longer wanted any part in this ordeal. I informed the branch manager that she could keep my card and should follow up with me at my current address, as I intended to explore alternative banking options going forward.

In conclusion, my long-standing trust and loyalty to Webster Bank have been shattered. What was once a reliable and trustworthy banking option has transformed into a soulless machine that seemingly couldn't care less about its longtime customers. Webster Bank, you have truly let me down and I'm looking forward to utilizing one of your many competitors for all of my accounts.

UPDATE: it's now been 14 days and I have not heard a response from Webster bank, this branch and I still have not received my replacement card.",1,Virginia,ChIJxZujsnhS5okRvn6HkCJ9sRM
03/03/2022 16:14:08,Cheryl Persaud,"I was inside the bank today at 10am.  The guy in front of me was rightfully frustrated that he had just waited over 20 minutes in the drive through while the clerk was dealing with a complicated issue with the customer in front of him.  He then gave up and came inside and waited another 10 minutes in line.  He explained the situation to the teller saying they should have asked the other customer to come inside instead of holding up the only drive up window.  The teller just blew off his complaint with the line ""I'll let someone know"".  At this point a manager came over and very rudely asked ""what is your issue?""  To which he again explained the problem.  She just made excuses that she is new and she can't help as a teller (not even the issue at hand).  Neither employee apologized for the situation and the manager continued to be extremely rude and unprofessional towards the guy.  I believe her name is Susan.   Perhaps Susan needs more training in customer service or shouldn't have a manager position at all if her go to response to a valid complaint is a nasty attitude.",1,Virginia,ChIJxZujsnhS5okRvn6HkCJ9sRM

After waiting 15-20 minutes, it was finally my turn and you guessed it....I was told to drive around to the front. UGH!!!! Not the tellers fault mind you.  They sent a different person to the door.  He was very pleasant, but signing bank papers on the sidewalk is not my idea of professional.  The same person I spoke to on the phone had previously tried calling me at home another time when she knew I was working with someone else.  Funny thing is I got a call at home a few days later telling me the bank hours (not a robocall).  I will be going to another branch or possibly another bank.  Don't like the games that lady plays.

Without hesitation she jumped to the opportunity to assist this gentleman and helped him out the door. My suspicions were correct, Elona is an angel. Her energy and professionalism is exceptional.

To make things clear my father is a white gentleman and I am Hispanic with a different last name. While lying to me about what was going on this bank was calling my father and telling him there was suspected fraud on him account and accusing me of stealing.

03/08/2024 18:04:58,Smokes Alloy,"Don't do it.  Webster/Brio will massively tie up your funds and charge you high fees for it.  Once they show ACH transfers inbound clear and funds available, if you try transferring any funds out, there are additional holds placed on the originally cleared funds, as well as the transfer holds, making your available balance negative.

Then transfers will fail due to lacking ""available"" funds, which were available at the time of transfer.  Each fee for this is $35 and they do retry failed transfers without checking if the funds are currently ""available"".

Then they will likely flag your account, request additional verification documents, and the account will be suspended for who knows how long until they get around to processing these documents.

For almost 1 month I have called Webster’s Customer Service and have received the worse service I have ever had. The first call told me erroneous information and told me to re-set up two Bill Pays that had been “lost” since the Sterling Bank system’s conversion. Wrong! They just weren’t visible online.  I called again to correct the double debits, was told by someone who couldn’t speak good English after 30 minutes or so that she would reverse the transactions. Never done. Called back to check on the status of the reversals. I was then transferred FIVE times - the final time I was transferred to Dollar Bank!!! I have nothing to do with a Dollar Bank. The total amount that was erroneously debited from my accounts is substantial. I went to my local branch and dealt with a knowledgeable person who, hopefully, is getting my problem corrected. Webster Bank has outsourced their Customer Service responsibilities to totally incompetent people who don’t understand English and certainly can’t speak it.

06/22/2023 13:40:32,Mark Gabriel,"I've been a loyal customer of Webster Bank for a staggering 40 years. However, I need to share my recent experience over the last 10 days, which has left me incredibly disappointed and frustrated.

It all began when Webster Bank notified me 10 days ago that my card was being deactivated due to unauthorized purchases that I had not made. Naturally concerned, I immediately contacted their customer service. They assured me that a new card would be expedited and I should receive it within 3 days.

However, 5 days passed, and I still hadn't received my new card. Anxious and perplexed, I called customer service again. This time, they admitted their mistake, stating that the card had not been expedited as promised. They assured me that I would receive the card within a maximum of 2 more days. At this point, I had already gone a full week without a functioning debit card.

Day 9 arrived, and I called Webster Bank once more, only to be informed that they would expedite another card, which I should receive in another 2-3 days. It seemed like an endless cycle of broken promises.

Finally, this morning, one of the cards showed up in my mailbox. Excited to regain access to my funds, I attempted to activate it but encountered an error. Annoyed, I called the activation number provided, only to be directed to visit a Webster branch. This is where things took an unexpected turn.

Upon entering my local branch and approaching a teller, I explained that I had been issued a new card but couldn't activate it. I handed over the card and my ID as requested. To my surprise, the teller whispered something unintelligible to her colleague, and suddenly, I found myself caught up in an ""investigation"" of sorts, apparently initiated by Webster Bank.

The branch manager then astonishingly informed me that MY card, with MY name on it, was stolen. This revelation left me dumbfounded. For the next 20 minutes, we went back and forth, as I desperately tried to resolve the situation and obtain a working card. It became increasingly clear that Webster Bank had made some sort of mistake, but they were unwilling to admit fault.

Growing increasingly frustrated and humiliated, I noticed a clear path to the exit. At that moment, I made the decision that Webster Bank could keep the card. I no longer wanted any part in this ordeal. I informed the branch manager that she could keep my card and should follow up with me at my current address, as I intended to explore alternative banking options going forward.

In conclusion, my long-standing trust and loyalty to Webster Bank have been shattered. What was once a reliable and trustworthy banking option has transformed into a soulless machine that seemingly couldn't care less about its longtime customers. Webster Bank, you have truly let me down and I'm looking forward to utilizing one of your many competitors for all of my accounts.

UPDATE: it's now been 14 days and I have not heard a response from Webster bank, the branch and I still have not received my replacement card.",1,Virginia,ChIJC2MwDarB54kR79mpobTLShY
09/02/2023 04:47:27,Nicholas Dukharan,I have been banking with Webster in Waterbury for many years and came to love this branch. The staff and service is amazing sometimes busy with hard parking but with the location it is expected. I would highly recommend speaking to Normaris or Luis for any questions or help. They are extremely helpful and willing to answer questions or concerns you have. 10/10,5,Virginia,ChIJC2MwDarB54kR79mpobTLShY

01/05/2023 18:02:34,Kennyat Kwnphoto gmail,"I am preparing to close my last account here.
Decades long customer thru many name changes and location closings.
Before my convenient local branch closed two years ago the new owners sent me many questionnaires and check lists to rate that branch with ?s like 'was I greeted with a smile?'.  I felt like a spy.  All favorable reviews from me. They closed the branch anyway and the new location was soooo much worse.
Most tellers had strong accents; that plus face masks = a real communication problem.
Two weeks ago I went there (Syosset) to close a cd.  At some point hat branch had been shut down without a word.  I walked around the building (10degreesF) to find the new address.
The new branch had one teller; while waiting my turn I walked 10 feet to check if the rear entrance worked or had parking. The teller is still with the earlier customer so I'm in no hurry. Then a newer cust enters goes right to the teller. She serves him right away totally blowing me off.  Btw the webster (or whatever they call themselves this week) cd interest rate was 0.01% compared to 4+% at rival bank. When I told the webster worker my new cd rate she said rates like that could ruin the economy... Really?  Really?   Your 0.01% interest rate cannot even buy a lollipop.
This Syosset branch is on their third manager in weeks.  Ask about that to see how fast they change the subject.
The barber shop next door gives more confidence and a lollipop.

AND do not answer with 'Response for the owner'  .... Too little too late. Treat your customer with respect before they come to close their accounts.",1,Virginia,ChIJ551oJUiCwokRqzivD24QLeU

12/03/2018 23:58:15,Amanda Knecht,"Staff seem friendly yet don’t follow through on what they say. I had an issue with the bank charging over draft fees, When I went to the branch in person, the woman helping me spent an hour on the phone with support staff trying to explain the charges to her, Clearly no one knew the answer and yet they refuse to refund me the entirety of the charges (only one Courtesy refund). I called today at 3:15 to ask about a transfer from another bank to my account, the woman at the branch seemed very frustrated with my call because she was “just leaving” and continued to huff and puff about my simple question as if I were a burden to her. She claimed that she was going to have someone look into the problem and get back to me. No one ever did. Poorly run branch and staff that is clearly just trying to “get through the day” and nothing else",1,Washington,ChIJA_hI6UnQ54kRz-wgS3sYGYM

12/15/2023 21:40:53,steven gomes,ATM has been down for far to long. Pull up to the drive up window and no one looks at you so after 10 minutes I drove off. I've been a customer for so long but I'm sorry to say I am about to leave as a customer along with the rest of my family.  Have to travel to a different city or town to bank with a webster ATM cost money in fuel. Using a different ATM costs you in fees. A bank is supposed to help you with money and not cost you more money in a world that is already overpriced.

Unfortunately I've had to go into branch to take care of a few things because husband died and months later, things aren't done, blame software, no communication/updates. One apology from one decent teller and I'm basically snubbed by manager.  I just want them to complete tasks and going forward if I need to go into branch I will go to out of town Webster location.
