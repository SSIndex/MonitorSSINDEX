"For several years a group of us flew to Anchorage in July. Eventually we found Icelandair. Back then the facilities at Keflavik were sparse but all the present facilities were under construction. 

We found the airline far better than the ones we used before. More seat space and the fact we could board at LHR and no customs to worry about until our final destination at Anchorage. The return flight was a redeye flight over the ice cap with the same customs arrangement in force.
Unfortunately they no longer fly direct to Anchorage. It was only available in summer. But it was great to leave London at 13.20 and be in our hotel in Alaska by 4.30pm.
Contrast this year when it took 150 minutes to clear customs at Denver and 90 minutes to clear security to our gate. 4 hours total.",25-09-2022 10:30,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Governance","Governance","Leadership and Governance","Leadership and Governance","COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR","COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR","ETHICAL PROTOCOLS",70,"PuntuaciÃ³n=70","si","POSITIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

"I personally love the new Icelandair livery, that shade of purple complements the white fuselage so well. Different coloured piping for the back of the tail representing different facets of Iceland is a nice touch too. I think the controversial nature of the rise of long narrowbody flights, is probably down to people associating them with LCCs with tight legroom and a mediocre offering overall. Consequently, they associate widebodies with business class suites and some of the worldâ€™s best airlines.

"Hi Simply Aviation, thanks for this great and interesting trip report! Let me add to your thoughts something... its true the 737max and A321 Neo are very efficient planes even on these long-haul routes. But there is another important aspect for airlines on these long-haul routes and its: cargo. These planes will never able to carry that much cargo as a heavy, twin-aisle aircraft and that is why we can't say fully this is the future. Yes, we're gonna see more and more often these smaller planes on these routesbut they will never replace and fully cut out the bigger planes. Some airlines will always stick to the ""heavy"" planes because , cargo is a pretty big aspect and business also for PAX airlines.",25-09-2022 10:30,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Social External","Social External","Social Capital","Social Capital","DATA SECURITY","DATA SECURITY","PRICE/QUALITY RATIO",75,"PuntuaciÃ³n=75","si","POSITIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

"As a Chinese who often flies Air China, I hope I can answer some of the questions in your video. First of all, itâ€™s about Air Chinaâ€™s pillows. Generally speaking, pillows departing from the home port (for Air China, itâ€™s PEK) are definitely clean. But their flights are usually same-day round-trips, so they wonâ€™t get a brand new pillow in Korea. That's why you see dirty pillows on the flight back to Beijing from South Korea. Secondly, many airports in China promote energy conservation, so their air conditioning is very limited, especially at night when no one is around, which is why you feel cold in winter. Finally, a big reason why connecting flights from China to Europe is cheaper is the cost savings due to access to Russian airspace.",06-04-2024 11:30,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Environmental","Environmental","Environment","Environment","AIR QUALITY","AIR QUALITY","ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS",60,"PuntuaciÃ³n=60","si","NEUTRAL","no","Aviation & Aerospace."
"Hey David, as a frequent traveler in China, I'd like to answer some of the oddities you've encountered in your trip. 

First of all, I am impressed that Air China even offered a hot meal service ICN-PEK. Chinese airlines are hand-stripped by a rule imposed by the CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) that strictly prohibits any cabin service 20 minutes after takeoff and 30 mins before landing. This leads to many of the shorter routes (usually less than 1.5h) operated by Chinese airlines has basically no service other than handing out a bottled water, international or domestic. For instance, I've flown China Southern on Seoul/ICN - Yantai/YNT, a route comparable to ICN-PEK, and I got nothing but a water and a bag of cookies. By contrast, the same route operated by Korean Air has full hot meal service and the flight attendants still have time to sell duty free. 

This also partly explains why cabin lights in your flight to Vienna was turned on very early. The crews just want the cabin cleared way before the 30-minutes requirement. Chinese pilots also has some odd behaviors, such as they never actually use the seat belt sign to indicate whether or not you should leave the seat and use the lavatory -- they just keep it on at all times.

Overhead screens are still common, but it is reported that some Chinese airlines are neglecting it in newer orders. They are quite funny, actually. I've been on plenty 4 to 5 hours-long domestic flights where overhead screens are the only entertainment, and flight attendants will actually hand out free earphones for you to tune in to those ""radio"" stations in your armrest. The big three carriers in China will always offer you a hot meal (if the flight is on meal time and it's longer than 1.5h) and 20kg of checked baggage, but unless you are flying a widebody, there's no personal IFE. No hot meal service if not on meal time -- this applies to domestic and international flights operated by the big three airlines. There's hardly any Wifi, but I'm cool with that anyways. Part of the reason why I prefer traveling by air over high-speed rail, is that there's no moron blasting TikTok on loudspeakers next to you.

For airports in Beijing, since the new Daxing (PKX) opens, it siphons plenty of traffic from PEK. As it turns out, Beijing just never really have enough international passengers (at least for this moment) to support two huge airports. Also, part of international flights departs from PEK's Terminal 2, that takes away more passengers from T3 to keep all the shops from running overnight.

PEK's T3 is infamous for being too cold during winter and too hot during summer. T3's building has very high celling and huge glass wall -- as shown in the video. This makes it easy for heat to get trapped in like a greenhouse, as well as for heat to escape during winter. So, basically, PEK's T3 just sucks at HVAC. 

Getting in airline lounges through Priority Pass may not be possible in the future. During Covid, many China Southern lounges across the country also allows PP holders to get in, but they stopped cooperation in early 2024. China Eastern lounges in PVG also never allows PP holders. But you can get in them if you have a credit card that has Plaza Premium access. This certainly makes me think PP access to Air China lounges may not last long, too.

Pressed vegetables are something that I particulate enjoy when flying Chinese airlines. Many in China prefers a saltier meal, so pressed vegetables are a good way to condition your dish. That's why no matter how mediocre the meal service is, there is always some kind of pressed or pickled vegetables. This is exactly how airlines should adapt to local taste. Even Delta and American provide chili sauce -- something to add flavor -- to their flight to Beijing, at least before Covid. 

Air China is the flag carrier of the People's Republic of China, but as seen in the video, some of its fleet has it's Chinese flag covered. These are planes that are flying to Taiwan. The bilateral treaty for civil aviation between Beijing and Taipei bans planes from flying the PRC's flag nor Taiwan (ROC)'s flag across the strait. China Airlines used to fly with ROC's flag on, but they changed all exterior design so it won't matter anyways; while Air China use part of its fleet that has the PRC flag covered to fly to Taiwan. It is said that Air China used to have one-third of its fleet with PRC flag covered.

Although Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern are all state-owned, this doesn't means competition don't exist. The last mainland Chinese airline videos on this channel are well before Covid, and they all changed quite a bit during the pandemic. China Southern implemented the most cost-cutting measures during Covid, made adjustments that caused the Chinese aviation geeks furious, while China Eastern crashed a plane but has been improving their service. You should try all these big airlines if you have time -- it's now visa free for many European citizens to get into China.

It should also be pointed out that airports in China can be quite different. Transiting in Beijing Capital (PEK) and Shanghai Pudong (PVG) just sucks. It's certainly better than some of the other airports that I've seen, but quite commonly I find myself helping some random foreigner in the terminal through the process or get a VPN that actually works. While Beijing Daxing (PKX) is much better -- they have policies that requires airport shops to sell at the same price as it is in downtown Beijing, and free transit resting areas, etc. I would recommend business travelers to avoid transiting in mainland China, unless the layover is short enough.",06-04-2024 11:30,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Environmental","Environmental","Environment","Environment","GHG EMISSIONS","GHG EMISSIONS","ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS",70,"PuntuaciÃ³n=70","si","POSITIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

I would fly with them again if the ticket price was good.

"As a Chinese and lived in Beijing, I always take Air Chinaâ€™s flight. Though their fleet age is very young compared with western airlines, but the seat and entertainment devise is out of date. If you gonna fly with Air China, avoid their B777-300er and A330-200. Their best aircraft is A350-900. Also I recommend you try to take China Eastern and Xiamen Airline.

"I recently flew Munich - Shanghai (A350) with Air China, and on the return journey SHA - PEK - MUC (B777). Got a very competitive deal at EUR 600 round trip and I was very positively surprised. This is def not the same airline that I recall from my childhood memory (I usually fly with China Eastern). Some points to share/confirm:

- MUC-PVG is very pleasant with a brand-new A350, great entertainment system and in-flight WiFi (again within firewall). Stewed beef was decent. Flight was loosely occupied so in some rows you can even lie down in economy.
- PEK-MUC is a bit worse with an older plane. Transfer not as pleasant since domestic flights arrive at a different section and needed a LONG walk to the security check and then taking the terminal trains. Heard some European transit passengers complaining about the lack of access to the ""outside"" internet which is totally understandable. So, it might be excruciating for those who've got long transfer (however, you can get VPN ahead). Different entertainment system but feels worse.

BTW, the straw is for the yoghurt because Chinese yoghurt is usually thinner than the European ones and is perceived more as a drink.

"Hi David! Some clarifications,

Beijing went through VERY heavy winterstorm with -30 degree C, where normally a daily low would be higher than -10 degree C. Heating is an infrastructure problem in that day.

In addition, Beijing has just opened a handful of international flights the shops have not yet adapted for the growth of traffic after a full lockdown of 3years. New tenants have yet to  move in so the airport seems desserted.

"A few secrets of why Air France does so well:  First off, linens for the return trip are sent with the departure.  It means that all of their blankets, pillowcases, and the like are generally treated at their ""home"" laundry.  Their quality standards as a result are much higher and easier to reach.   When it comes to food, they are also very particular about quantity and quality, and to my knowledge do more meal tastings and such than most others to perfect the products from each of their bases.  They also have generally very good staff on the ground at every destination that work hard to assure that the quality of the cleaning, prep, and ground services are up to standard every day.

They are not the greatest airline ever, but they are an airline with high standards that translates generally to a good trip and consistent levels of service and such.",24-06-2023 10:30,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Social Internal","Social Internal","Human Capital","Human Capital","EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY","EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY","MATERIALS & EQUIPMENT",85,"PuntuaciÃ³n=85","si","POSITIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

"Back in February 2020 (just before Covid hit) my parents and I were on vacation in Indonesia. We were checking flight offers from Berlin (still TXL back then) to Denpasar and were actually considering Scoot for a moment. I watched a trip report on their 787 too, I think it might've even been on this channel. We decided against it eventually, especially because my mom wouldn't agree to spending 12+ hours without entertainment. When we finally went to Indonesia again over Christmas 2022, almost 3 years later, we still decided for full service airlines instead. It's worth the extra money to us xD

The longest low cost flight I had so far was on EasyJet from Berlin BER to Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt, around 4 hours of flight time time (+ the return flight obviously).

"I took this flight from Singapore to Berlin (return) in 2019 and paid SGD 545 (or 380â‚¬) base fare and I agree with your whole assessment with the exception of in-seat power. Power supply is not a basic necessity and most people bring their power banks so Scoot charging for it seems like fair game as a low-cost carrier. I especially agree with your assessment on the price of water and quality of food. I don't understand why they can't emulate AirAsia's quality. Also, I paid extra for Scoot-in-silence and I can't recommend it enough. Seats had more legroom but more importantly, you were guaranteed no screaming infant in that section of the cabin or unruly child kicking the back of your seat. Certainly helps with anxiety! In that regard, Scoot may be a better option compared to other airlines (especially SQ where their amenities, quality and portion of food in economy class have been declining since the resumption of travel but their prices have increased substantially).

"I travelled SYD-TXL in 2018 with Scoot. By the time weâ€™d added on meals, seat selection, and luggage (we were moving, so packing light was not an option) it came out pretty much on par with any other airline cost-wise. Service was average (not bad, but not excellent, no surprises) and in general it got the job done. Nothing to complain about other than everything beingâ€¦average. Main reason I wouldnâ€™t fly with them again is that for the same money long-haul you get an overall better experience, or close enough that paying full-service is worth it just for not being soâ€¦average. If short-haul no-frills is all you need though, Scoot will get the job done well enough.

Absolutely not â€œlong-haul Ryanairâ€ though, as someone said. Ryanair is built around explicitly screwing you while being just good enough at the bare-bones stuff that people can still convince themselves that itâ€™s worth the suffering. All states quite publicly by its owner, who makes no secret as to the contempt he has for his passengers. Scoot, on the other hand, is just an airline trying its best at the budget end and mostly succeeding.

"Compare to what some low-cost carriers offer on a long-haul flight (specifically Scoot), I personally agree with you that Zipair is one of the best out there. At first, I can't really believe myself when you say there's a free wifi and it's unlimited. Secondly, the price itself is also very very cheap and fair, with just almost $400 you spend on this 11 hour flight, you got what you get on a premium service airline (Meals and Amenities). Meal itself also looks better than some premium service airline tbh. Yet there's an universal power-outlet and USB port which every pax can used for an unlimited time.

"I became a Captain on the B757 on April 2001. Loved flying the a/c. It was brilliant and runway performance was never an issue. Great landing performance too with a VRef of 132KT at MLM (90000KG) with 8 brakes. Typical 233 pax ZFW was about 79000KG, so Landing weight was usually around 83000KG. The RR211-535E4 had masses of power and the CAT IIIB Autoland down to 75m RVR with No DH was awesome. The AFDS (Autopilot Flight Director System) with triple IRS, triple Autopilot and triple Flight Director was a joy. We had the a/c in all Economy 233 seats and used to operate from the UK to the USA, Canada, all Europe as well as the Middle and Far East. A W E S O M E! As I recall, you could have pretty much max ZFW (83500KG) plus max Fuel (31400KG Fuel). Not a feat many a/c could achieve. As I recall, an average en-route tailwind component of about 43 KT meant it could do Orlando Florida to London non-stop with 233 pax. With its wonderful power and performance,take-off at MTOM of 115000+KG was ok even up to around 34 deg C on a decent runway. There were times when we could have taken off from some shortish runways in the Greek Islands surrounded by terrain with 233 pax and a tailwind when other types could not get away at all with a full Economy Config load. We even had to take much of their baggage load as well as our own so they could depart without a tech-stop. We were rightly instructed by our Director of Flight Operations to only carry the bags for non B757 Company a/c as helping other operators who had not invested in the 757 was giving them an unfair advantage. Iâ€™ll never forget the mighty 757 - a thing of beauty and supreme performance capability. Ot looked right and it flew right!

"I flew the 757 out of Denver for 2-1/2 years, mainly on trips to Hawaii (Lihue on Kauai, Maui, and Kona on the Big Island).  I've also flown the A319/320 series - with over 6,500 hours on the type.  I'm back flying the A319/320 series as a result of everything Covid related.  The 757 is what I like to call ""old school"" technology.  Nothing fancy, but it's very much a pilot's machine.  The 757 has such an amazing capability for what it does that it's going to be very hard to replace.  We could take a full load of passengers on a hot summer's day from Denver to Lihue (the furthest Hawaii destination) without any performance issues.  Conversely, loading up a full 757 and departing from Lihue's relatively short 6,500' runways (back to Denver) wasn't an issue either.  While I also enjoy the Airbus, I am a bit skeptical as to whether the A321XLR will be able to actually replace the 757 on the same routes.  I've seen the engineering and the marketing numbers for the A321XLR, and they certainly look impressive.  HOWEVER,  the 757 is a well proven machine, the A321XLR is not.  Don't get me wrong here, I am a fan of the A320 series overall.

"I have always maintained that the 757-200, aka VC-32 in USAF parlance, is basically a two engine version of the 707-120 with STOL capabilities . Which is why the USAF replaced their all of their VIP 707 transports, the VC-137, with the exception of course the ones that were used for Air Force One which were famously replaced by the 747-200, with the 757.
The market niche and justification for 757 didn't fully materialized until after Boeing ended production in 2004 with the international acceptance of 120 min ETOPS . Especially for long and thin trans-Atlantic routes/missions. Such as Chicago-O'Hare-Manchester, England (ORD-MAN). But I am not surprised that Boeing was in a hurry to terminate the 757 Program and to  bulk up the smaller regional design 737 to take over the 757's missions.

"The 757 is my favorite commercial airliner for all the reasons you mentioned in this video.  A testament to it's greatness is that the airlines that still fly them, primarily United and Delta in the U.S., keep flying these planes that are 30+ years old.  It begs the question: is there an absolute limit to how long they can fly the 757?  Is there a maximum number of cycles?  Can they be flown indefinitely with adequate inspection and maintenance?

"they should have done a 757 NG (next gen) option starting in 2000 for airlines to consider. They should, if they dont want to lose massive market share for the long and skinny point to point consider doing a 757 NEO in the next year or two. The positives of doing so are numerous. especially considering that most if not all airlines have kept their 57s in service for more than 15 years after they said they wanted to retire the type. secondly, the majority of the tooling for the type and the wide body 67 are actually still around. In fact for the 67 the production line and supply routes are still operating (they still make the 767-f and are currently (trying) to make a tanker for the airforce). So there is market demand, the new engine option and updated avionics would make it as fuel efficient or near enough to be a non factor as the 37 max, and they can quickly start production of the new generation thanks to the lines and tooling they already have.",03-02-2021 16:42,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Environmental","Environmental","Social Capital","Social Capital","DATA SECURITY","DATA SECURITY","ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS",75,"PuntuaciÃ³n=75","si","POSITIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

He's the reason that there are airbags in seat belts in all cars today! Well, Ralph Nader's niece was on that Ethiopian crash. Their family is now suing Boeing and the FAA. Former and current Boeing engineers were subpoenaed to provide information on Boeing's design and certification process. One of their former flight controls engineer, Peter Lemme disclosed that Boeing has repeatedly and intentionally violated key system safety design principles and egregiously abused its FAA certification designee position to allow it to pass certification muster, resulting in hundreds of Boeing airplane passenger deaths and injuries over the years. 


When MCAS engaged during the last nose dive on the Ethiopian flight, the aircraft was recorded at a speed of about 500 mph (faster than any 737 Max has likely ever flown at that altitude!) and at a downward angle of 40 degrees!!

"It is not appropriate to say that one aircraft manufacturer is ""better"" than the other, as both Airbus and Boeing have their own unique features and capabilities. Both companies have a long history of producing high-quality aircraft and have contributed significantly to the aviation industry.

One key difference between Airbus and Boeing is the types of aircraft they produce. Airbus is known for producing a range of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, including the A320 and A380, while Boeing primarily focuses on producing narrow-body aircraft, such as the 737 and 777.

Both Airbus and Boeing have strong reputations for safety and reliability, and both companies have a long history of producing aircraft with advanced technologies and features. Ultimately, the decision of which aircraft to purchase depends on the specific needs and requirements of the airline, including factors such as range, seating capacity, fuel efficiency, and cost.

The angle of attack is a much more complex flight parameter in this age of variable geometry AC than in was when flight control augmentation systems were first invented. Pitch, roll and Yaw are fundamentally inertial variables, and little has changed in regard to their utilization  as feedback variables. Angle of attach is completely different. One could say it is an indicator of air speed direction at a particular sensor location. At a given time it's different all over the AC surface.This has impacted the 737, but really is an issue for all modern large AC. The Angle of attach sensed near the nose of an aircraft infers the angle of attack of the main wing through a complex relationship. This is a serious issue.

"This runs deeper than MCAS. This is the result of the formerly engineering company being taken over by the accounting department. The entire corporate culture changed for the worse after the merger with McD. This is not just Boeing, it is widespread across many industries. This is what destroyed the American auto industry. Accountants are necessary for very specific and limited things. When they take over, they invariably destroy the company. In this case, also killed over 300 people.

I see two major problems with MCAS:

First, it relies on just one AOA sensor. I can't think of anything in aviation that doesn't have some kind of redundancy, yet Boeing did this, and the FAA approved it.

Second, the software is incredibly bad. It apparently has to logic as to whether it is getting good data or not. And it has no limits, if it gets bad data, it will drive the tailplane as far as it will go and keep trying. A high-school kid could have written better software.

Thirdly, Boeing hid the whole mess. There should  be a great big flashing red light on the dashboard when MCAS is active. Instead, Boeing barely even mentioned it to the pilots.

It goes further than that though. The 737 design is now over 40 years old, and should have been retired decades ago. Instead, the accountants retired its successor, the excellent 757, because they figured in the short run they could make more money milking the older design. You can bet the engineers weren't happy about that.

The 737 was designed for small-diameter turbojet engines. The new large-diameter turbofans not only increase the thrust, but they change the thrust line, which is the reason for the pitching moment. Also, the landing gear is short and stubby, and as a result, the new engines practically drag on the ground. How the FAA approved all of this is beyond me.

"It is totally understandable that China has enough of paying high prices to foreign companies. Chinese engineers are well-trained and hard-working. They have built moon and mars landers. Of course China will eventually fly Chinese planes in China and not planes from the US or from Europe. The same with cars in particular EV's and other high-tech such as electronics. And potentially they will be more competitive than Europe and the US  and take a dominating share of the international market. 
It is deserved because the Western CEO's, CFO's and stockholders had dollar signs in their eyes seeing China as a huge export market for technological products so they could gain more money. The Chinese liked the products and learned how to produce them themselves even more efficiently than the Western exporters. Those who play with fire eventually get burned.

In the meantime the Western technological industry is becoming ever more entangled in bureaucracy, regulations, audits, short-term optimization and seem to lack research in their core products to make any real advances.

"Boeing 737 series was designed 50 years ago thou it continues to improve/upgrade on many things, like engine, control system, materials, over time. But the backbones and basic design in 737 are never changed. Becuase it is pretty much re-designing a new plane from scratch if you want to leverage the current aerodynamic concept and technology. This process will take many years and Boeing is seeing that it will lose the competition with Airbus. So Boeing took the short cuts to compete with Airbus, the most obvious evidence is the oval engines with the lowest ground clearance. Boeing even did not tell airlines that 737 Max is equipped with MCAS and no information is displayed in manuals so airlines do not have to spend time and money for extra pilots training.

"Airlines are still flying it, because there is no direct replacement (yet). A330Neo and 787 are too big and expensive, A321(XLR) is not big enough, and well, a narrow body aircraft cannot be a true replacement of a wide body.
It is interesting that the closest possible substitute was already retired before 767. That aircraft is A310 ðŸ¤”
There are rumors that Boeing is considering a reengined 767Plus, instead of a clean sheet NMA. I think it is not a bad idea at all. 767 production line is still there, development costs of a Plus variant will be minimal and therefore price can be kept around the expected range by the airlines, which is ~$75M net. 
A clean-sheet design NMA will be obviously more efficient in terms of fuel economy, but NMA will be a risky move for Boeing if they want to keep that price level.
For comparison, note that after 10+ years and 1000+ units of production, 787 still could not break even and probably will never financially succeed.

"A321XLR has a nominal range of 4,700NM. That is in still air. In real life that will mean at best 4,000NM considering mandatory fuel reserves and headwind. It can also carry depending on cabin configuration in excess of 200 pax. What it positively cannot do is both things simultaneously. For long range missions it can take some 150 pax. Further, it has a rather poor field performance (i.e. limitations in high and/or hot airports, it needs extralong
runways). This said, A321XLR is a very interesting design that will do quite well. Yet it only covers the lower end of the middle of the market, both in range and in capacity. So airlines would hace been delighted to see a 7M7 concept come to fruition. Under present market conditions it will be a cold day in hell before it happens, firstly for the high development costs, secondly because even with the aforesaid limitations Airbus has sucessfully managed to bite into the MOM market to sucessfully prevent their competitor to enter an alternate design. Which is a pity, since both concepts are actually complimentary rather than competitive, and large airlines could conceivably use both. For the upper end of the MOM existing aircraft are definitely unsuited. Both 787-8 and A330-800 are too big and heavy hulls to offer competitive costs on ranges up to 4-5,000NM. They were simply never designed for that purpose. Boeing has an additional problem in these uncertain times. Replacing the MAX, a 50 year old design that has seen better days. A320NEO beats the -8 counterpart in performance and sales, and A321NEO simply routs -9 and -10 hand down. So the Americans will have to devote their best efforts to come up with a new single aisle alternate design. As things are today it will be impossible to fund two projects that essentially cater to a similar market bracket.",26-09-2020 20:34,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Environmental","Environmental","Human Capital","Human Capital","LABOR PRACTICES","LABOR PRACTICES","ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS",55,"PuntuaciÃ³n=55","si","NEUTRAL","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

"Jeb:  I flew a Pan Am 747 from LAX to Caraccas Venezuela.  Back in the '70s, Pan Am gave the entire first class access upstairs for the main meal.  Upstairs, they had legitimate linen-covered tables, china plates and lead-crystal goblets.  The chairs faced in towards the tables.  I had the rack of lamb, cooked on-board.  So cool!!!  So many american carriers figure you don't need ""first-class"" service when you are rewarded with giant seats.  Recently, on my way to Chicago, I took American Airlines, first class.

"Great video, I like how you covered each area thoroughly.  I've flown both the 747 and A380, and I don't think the A380 is that much of a difference as you made out.  The 747's look is unquestionably iconic, so it wins that category.  But the A380 is a wonderful airplane and sitting in the upper deck is a truly unique experience. I actually couldn't tell when the aircraft left the runway on takeoff, and I didn't feel a single bounce when it landed.  The A380 I flew was British Airways out of Heathrow, non-stop to San Francisco, and I flew World Traveler Plus, better-known as Premium Economy.  We didn't get a fully-reclining seat, but had great meals, great drinks, and great service.  In fact, we had the same pre-landing menu as you did: I loved the Aubergine (eggplant) parmigiana.

"Why is Boeing constantly using Airbus to justify shortcuts around safety regulations?
Airbus has a normal R&D department that is developing new planes. They have regulations, design rules and basic engineering principles for their work. The result are reasobably well engineered planes which are popular with the Airlinea and pilots.
Airbus just chugged on and  talked to airlines and pilots and developed a superior product,  even in the face of a dominating competitor like Boeing. 
Boeing on the other hand invests as little as possible in R&D. They designed a great series of planes in the 60s with a state of the art user interface of the time. 
So, instead of developing new planes for consecutive models or variants,  they kept bolting one kludge after another kludge.
After all they know all there is to know about jets and customers bl00dy well should buy those old planes. They were Boeing quality after all! 
That seemed to.be very prifitable until it killed hundreds of people.
Congress and the FAA are justifiably wary of Boeing's certification behaviour and understandvthatbthey need to protect the flying public of Boeing's shoddy practuces. 
Now once again the competitor argument is being made to justify another shortcut! 
How about doing the engineering right for once and not just politic around! Another shortcut may kill more people. 
But then, the US Congress finds it acceptable to hace schoolkids shot at school in the hundreds every year.
If a government is not able to protect vulnerable kids, can it really be expected to give a flying fÎ¼Â©k about a few hundred dead every few years?

"Interesting video, but I'd say largely flawed. The single biggest cost to airlines is fuel over an aircraft's life not the upfront cost. It doesn't matter if a 737 can carry X passengers a further Ynm if it uses more fuel to do that. According to Wikipedia (I know, probably questionable, but the intent stands), the A320neo has a fuel efficiency per seat of 2.25 litres / km and the 737 MAX 9 has 2.28... that's a 1.3% difference which might not seem much but is actually enormous in the aviation industry. Note that the addition of Sharklets on the A320neo gave a 3-4% fuel burn saving, and only up to that much on flights with long cruise segments!

It's way more complicated than this as these numbers are likely assuming a full cabin, full fuel tanks and maximum ranges, airline operations obviously very rarely meet all 3 of these criteria. Airlines will run all the very complicated calculations and find out what suits their network best to even achieve a fraction of a percentage in fuel savings. Paying slightly more for an aircraft you want will pay for itself in the long run in fuel savings.",14-07-2022 11:00,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Environmental","Environmental","Environment","Environment","GHG EMISSIONS","GHG EMISSIONS","ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS",60,"PuntuaciÃ³n=60","si","NEUTRAL","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

The software is what made it unsafe, not the 60 years old airframe, airlines don't care how old the airframe is, as long as it gets upgraded along with technological development in the aviation industry, as is the case for A320 and 737.
MCAS's purpose was to change the flight characteristics and control surface handling to make it similar to 737NG as a solution for engine placement problems.
Technically the 737 Max is flyable without an MCAS system, but it was installed for training cost cuts, and somehow Boeing decided to hide the system back then.

"You can't make that statement with all honesty that you did with the 737 being out the 319 because of its 100 mile great range being more fuel efficient WITHOUT knowing its fuel capacity for that range and comparing that as well.  Plus, as you point out...the Airbus has 7 more seats which, again as you state, increases weight and thus reduces range if the fuel to move that additional weight isn't factored in to the totals.  To say the 737 is more fuel efficient is a total based on those parameters is disingenuine.

Where Airbus was looking with the A321neo/XLR is the direct replacement for the aging 757 fleet and the airlines who have, had or still desire that capacity and range (TATL is where the ship found its niche on long thin routes after its discontinuation) Airbus wants that market.

What's funny about the total series sales for the two...the Boeing was launched in the 60s and had nigh on 20 years of advance production time over the Airbus.  In fact, it was flying in airline service for almost a decade before Airbus even existed.  So I'd say Airbus has done on heck of a job to have caught up in a much shorter production time.

As a former ramp rat and as a passenger, while I am a Boeing fan for it being a US product...you cannot beat the Airbus for comfort and ride as well as the qualities it has on the ramp.  I HATED seeing a damn 737 on the schedule.  Give me the Bombardier regionals, the Douglas/McDonnell Douglas T-tails and the Airbus' all day long.  I hated the 737 if I was anything other than the ramp boss and not actively having to work on it.

Bottom line...both are great products regardless of whether a person is a Boeing or Airbus person.  Companies have such a complex process for decision making, but it goes well beyond the numbers and in some cases, nationalism plays a roll as well.  In the end, how each manufacturer manages to do it, I really don't know.  Each airline wants its own specs and tells the builders what they want and what Ryanair and Southwest want may not line up with someone else's need...but who ultimately will the designers listen to?  Their sales department.  He who has the biggest interest will get most of what they want ultimately and everyone will have to adjust.

That's why the MAX had the issues it has.  Southwest Airlines is the cause of that.  100% on the shoulders of them.  They demanded the commonality for the pilots and as such, to make the MAX feel like it flies like the NG, they had to put systems in that changed the feel of the plane for them.  Problem was, they didn't tell the other airlines of this feature and and as result, the crashes because the system for Southwest was a unspoken ""secret.""",14-07-2022 11:00,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Social External","Social External","Social Capital","Social Capital","CUSTOMER PRIVACY","CUSTOMER PRIVACY","PRICE/QUALITY RATIO",30,"PuntuaciÃ³n=30","si","NEGATIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

On my way to the airport, the 747 was flying parallel to the Expressway, it looked like it was hanhing in the sky and not moving.

Having other pilots on board has crossed my mind too...I always feel better when i see extra crew travelling along. My Dad would commute to work on a flight from where we lived to fly out of different airports, depending on where he was stationed. So, there are extra pilots on board sometimes. Of course, he sat in the cockpit then sometimes so if they all ate the fish, well, glad the drone pilot is on board! I enjoy your adventures!

"Thanks for honestly sharing the Air India, not so Business class flight experience. 
After watching this video, I will never fly Air India.
Once, I went on vacation to India with family. Our luggage didnâ€™t arrive at Mumbai airport. A Security guard suggested to look for it myself. He even opened the door to the runway for me. I walked up to the plane when it was dark at night and heavy rain. At least the guard was right, my luggage was sitting on the ground. Dragged 5 suitcases, one at a time, into the baggage area.

"I've had the displeasure of knowing a few Air India employees. They're full of themselves, arrogant, huge sense of entitlement, smug in the knowledge that no matter what happens their jobs are secure (this was true until Air India was privatised - hopefully they no longer have this ridiculous sense of security), highly unionized, highly political and prone to threatening the management, crafty tactics about how to stiff the management and skirt the law, and rude as hell. The shabby aircraft are merely a reflection of their shabby attitudes and the general fatalistic/corrupt mindset that pervades the country itself. Hopefully the Tatas will turn this airline around and restore it to its old glory, but with thousands of dinosaurs working for it and everything in India subject to political whims that will be a challenge.",26-06-2022 12:10,"Boeing","Youtube",3,"Illinois","Social Internal","Social Internal","Business Model and Innovation","Business Model and Innovation","PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE","PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE","TRAINING",10,"PuntuaciÃ³n=10","si","NEGATIVE","no","Aviation & Aerospace."

"I also hate the crew controlled windows. The cabin always feels so much more confined when they are locked closed during daylight and they do provide eye shades for those with issues.
