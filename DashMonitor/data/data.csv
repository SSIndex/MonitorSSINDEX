"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to John Dollerry for his invaluable assistance in helping me and my family with trading. I am delighted to inform you that I successfully withdrew my funds (cash out) yesterday. I must say, John is by far the best trader I have ever come across.
After numerous experiences of being defrauded of my hard-earned money, I was skeptical about investing again. However, John's reliability, expertise, and professionalism completely changed my perspective. I invested $1000 and earned an impressive $8,800, which was much easier than I had anticipated.
I wholeheartedly recommend John Dollerry as a genuine and trustworthy trader to anyone interested in investing and trading. You can reach him via email at dollerryjohn062@gmail.com or through Telegram at t.me/johndollerry.

"El peor servicio y experiencia que he tenido en mi vida con una institución. Desde el inicio se tuvo que corregir el contrato de apertura por que los datos que el banco puso eran inventados o falsos;Como banco solo se puede depositar pero no retirar, la banca electrónica es imposible de usar, inventan la información aún que la corregí varias veces, me mandaron un cuestionario con respuestas inventadas por ellos por que así  ingresaron los datos la gente de sistemas para poder usar la banca electrónica. Actúan como usureros, con llamadas al vencimiento de los préstamos de 6 a 8 llamadas por cada dos minutos lo cual está penado por la condusef, son irresponsables,abusivos y muy poco serios. Ojalá pongan atención y sean profesionales y mejoren en un futuro. o mejor aún desaparezcan. Este mensaje es una alerta para todos que tienen una necesidad y creen en las fantasías que propone este banco pero solo eso fantasías más no realidades. A mi no me funciono quizá a otros si le llegue a funcionar. Esta institución se defenderá pero solo basta con leer la calificaciones en redes y leer comentarios para darte cuenta de la trampas, y mal servicio que tienen, yo no soy el único. Sin embargo creo que lo mejor es alertar de la manera más objetiva y sin mentiras.","The worst service and experience I have ever had in my life with an institution. From the beginning, the opening contract had to be corrected because the data that the bank provided was invented or false; As a bank you can only deposit but not withdraw, electronic banking is impossible to use, they invent the information even though I corrected it several times. Sometimes, they sent me a questionnaire with answers invented by them because that&#39;s how the systems people entered the data to be able to use electronic banking. They act like usurers, with 6 to 8 calls per two minutes when loans expire, which is punishable by the condusef, they are irresponsible, abusive and very unserious. I hope they pay attention and are professional and improve in the future. or better yet disappear. This message is an alert for everyone who has a need and believes in the fantasies that this bank proposes, but only fantasies, not realities. It didn&#39;t work for me, maybe it will work for others. This institution will defend itself but you only have to read the ratings on networks and read comments to realize the traps and poor service they have, I am not the only one.

"Primer salida a San Quintín 9:00am.
Salidas a Tj cada media hora y a Mexicali cada 4h.

Servicio promedio. Normalmente está desordenado y sucio. Tiene mucho flujo diario y poco mantenimiento.

Las salidas suelen demorar entre 15-30min después de la hora marcada oficial en el boleto.

Recomiendo encarecidamente realizar un doble chequeo de su boleto para evitar malas asignaciones de destinos.

Hay que estar muy atentos al momento de querer abordar ya que es común que el número de autobús en el boleto no coincida con el número real del autobús. Sobre todo en salidas ABC.

De igual manera al comprar comida en las tienditas hay que revisar que esté en buenas condiciones.

Hay unos baños públicos gratuitos hasta arriba, al final del andén. Recomiendo más los de paga pero pues, son gratis.

Tampoco recomiendo comprar boletos de manera online ya que es común que al llegar el autobús o su horario realmente no existen o no está registrada la compra, lo que genera aún más retraso de salidas.","First departure to San Quintín 9:00am.

"Escogimos este lugar, pensando que era la mejor opción para celebrar el 50 Aniversario de mi familiar.
Ellos vinieron desde México para este festejo.
Estábamos seguros que el lugar era el mejor.
Que decepción
En lo personal no vuelvo a regresar.
Teníamos que estar casi rogando para que nos pusieran pan en la mesa, y cuando se acababa pasaban y pasaban los meseros sin hacernos caso.
Pésimo el servicio
Muy tardado
Y cuando por fin nos tomaron lo que íbamos a pedir, se le dió al mesero las especificaciones de la carne.
Haciendo caso omiso a ellas.
Nos llevó después de mucho tiempo la carne únicamente sellada, y tardaron mucho en llevar un amarre, para que nosotros hiciéramos el trabajo de asar la carne.
En verdad que mala experiencia.
Y pena con nuestros familiares que esperaban un muy buen Restaurante con excelente servicio.","We chose this place, thinking it was the best option to celebrate my family&#39;s 50th Anniversary. They came from Mexico for this celebration. We were sure that the place was the best. What a disappointment. Personally, I will not return. We had to be almost begging for bread to be put on the table, and when it was gone the waiters passed and passed without paying any attention to us. Terrible service. Very late. And when they finally took what we were going to order, the waiter was given the specifications of the meat. Ignoring them. After a long time he brought us the meat only sealed, and it took a long time to bring a tie so that we could do the work of roasting the meat. Truly a bad experience.

"Una experiencia sobrevalorada

El restaurante cuenta con una buena imagen, el servicio suele ser atento, sin embargo la comida deja un tanto que desear.

No se dejen engañar, aunque el “Ribeye Delmonico” suene interesante (y aparente ser un mejor corte dado el peso en gramos con el cual se vende), no tiene sabor ni calidad. Y no sé si fue por los meseros o así salió de cocina, pero cuando me fue servido, estaba tíbio/frío.

Los vegetales a la parrilla - aunque carecían de más sazón - eran buena elección y tenían tanto buena presentación así como sabor.

Personalmente son más adepto a platillos de sabor más fuerte y característico, sin embargo aquí faltó ese factor.

Sin duda, un restaurante no apropiado para aquellos que buscan disfrutar un corte de carne - si tu plan es socializar, tal vez sea adecuado para ti.","An overrated experience The restaurant has a good image, the service is usually attentive, however the food leaves something to be desired. Don&#39;t be fooled, although “Ribeye Delmonico” sounds interesting (and appears to be a better cut given the weight in grams with which it is sold), it has no flavor or quality. And I don&#39;t know if it was because of the waiters or if it came from the kitchen, but when it was served to me, it was warm/cold. The grilled vegetables - although lacking more seasoning - were a good choice and had both good presentation and flavor. Personally, they are more adept at dishes with a stronger and more characteristic flavor, however that factor was lacking here. Certainly not a restaurant suitable for those looking to enjoy a cut of meat - if your plan is to socialize, perhaps it is suitable for you.",2023-05-26,ABC Capital,maps,Querétaro,35,Social Capital,Social External,PRICE/QUALITY RATIO,CUSTOMER WELFARE,no,no,Social External,Social Capital,POSITIVE,2023.0,May,5.0,Querétaro

"En ventanilla el servicio de las cajeras de Scotiabank es muy eficiente, pero la semana pasada que llevé a mi mamá (una señora de la tercera edad) a buscar la tarjeta de una cuenta que abrimos vía Internet, estuvimos esperando un poco más de una hora y ninguno de los ejecutivos nos preguntó que operación íbamos a hacer.

Normalmente son amables pero ese día uno de los ejecutivos no estaba, vi que la señorita que atiende en el primer cubículo atendió a otra persona que estaba en la sala de espera. En la oficina de la gerente estaban un señor y un joven.

Luego vi que la misma señorita del primer cubículo se desocupó, pensé que nos iba a llamar o a preguntar que operación íbamos a realizar, pero no, ella se fue al cubículo de la gerente y ahí estuvo varios minutos, entonces me levanté y tuve que interrumpir.

Dije que teníamos mucho tiempo esperando, que si se iban a tardar mucho, creo que la gerente se molestó y contestó: ""Sí, me voy a tardar"", le pregunté y la señorita? dirigiendome a la señorita del primer cubículo que estaba parada ahí mismo, y la gerente contestó: ""ella va a salir"".

Les dije que para mí era difícil estar llevando a mi mamá, que por favor necesitaba que nos atendieran, que sólo íbamos por una tarjeta de una cuenta que abrimos por Internet.

Entonces la señorita del primer cubículo dijo: ""¿sólo vienen a recoger una tarjeta?"" ah, bueno, entonces pasen y así fue como por fin nos atendió, se tardó alrededor de 10 minutos porque se distrajo con alguien que le llamó y le pidió algo por teléfono.

Esto fue hace varios meses con la gerente anterior, había otro personal, lo cambiaron todo! Ahora hay mejor servicio, la nueva gerente súper atenta, siempre disponible (Mayo 2023) hay 3 ejecutivas y me da gusto verlas a todas tan atentas.

Laa cajeras son muy sonrientes y súper amables, una de ellas es más rápida y la otra es un poquito lenta y se pone nerviosa, pero debe ser porque es nueva.","At the counter, the Scotiabank ATM service is very efficient, but last week when I took my mother (an elderly lady) to look for the card for an account that we opened online, we were waiting a little over an hour and none of the executives asked us what operation we were going to do. Normally they are friendly but that day one of the executives was not there, I saw that the lady who serves in the first cubicle attended to another person who was in the waiting room. In the manager&#39;s office were a man and a young man. Then I saw that the same lady from the first cubicle vacated, I thought she was going to call us or ask what operation we were going to perform, but no, she went to the manager&#39;s cubicle and was there for several minutes, then I got up and had to interrupt . I said that we had been waiting for a long time, that they were going to take a long time, I think the manager got upset and answered: &quot;Yes, I&#39;m going to take a while,&quot; I asked her and the lady? I turned to the lady in the first cubicle who was standing right there, and the manager answered: &quot;she&#39;s going out.&quot; I told them that it was difficult for me to be taking my mother, that please I needed them to help us, that we were only going to get a card from an account that we opened online. Then the lady in the first cubicle said, &quot;Are you just coming to pick up a card?&quot; Ah, well, then come in and that&#39;s how he finally attended to us, it took about 10 minutes because he was distracted by someone who called him and asked him for something on the phone. This was several months ago with the previous manager, there was other staff, they changed everything! Now there is better service, the new manager is super attentive, always available (May 2023) there are 3 executives and I am happy to see them all so attentive. The cashiers are very smiling and super friendly, one of them is faster and the other is a little slow and gets nervous, but it must be because she is new.",2023-12-07,Banca Afirme,maps,Nuevo León,65,Human Capital,Social Internal,WORK-LIFE BALANCE,EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY,si,si,Social Internal,Human Capital,POSITIVE,2023.0,December,12.0,Monterrey

"Esta sucursal del banco Afirme está ubicado en la periferia del monumento a la revolución, se especializa en créditos que mejoran el patrimonio; es la sucursal principal para crédito hipotecario.
Desafortunadamente el servicio es mucho peor de lo que uno espera para un banco, uno pensaría que nadie conoce Afirme o no hay muchos clientes (y justo no hay muchos clientes) pero la principal razón es la pésima actitud de la gente que trabaja dentro.
Desde asesores clasistas, un servicio de turnos insuficiente y erróneo, así como su pésima atención a seguimiento de solicitudes.
Entre a tomar un turno, la señorita “Adri” de la entrada estaba jugando con su compañero y 25 minutos después me preguntó cuál trámite iba a realizar…
(¿Entonces no hace falta que saques turno?) Cuando le dije que era trámite inmobiliario me dijo que debía esperar al asesor. Más que obvio diría yo.
El colmo fue cuando saqué mi celular para ver qué llevaba una hora de espera que la señorita me gritó que el servicio estaba limitado y lo guardara (pero a nadie más le dijo eso) por eso tomé mis fotos.
Mi error, ir de sudadera y botas por la lluvia de esta temporada .

Unfortunately the service is much worse than what one expects for a bank, one would think that no one knows Afirme or there aren&#39;t many customers (and there just aren&#39;t many customers) but the main reason is the terrible attitude of the people who work inside. From classist advisors, an insufficient and erroneous shift service, as well as their terrible attention to tracking requests. I went in to take a turn, Miss “Adri” at the entrance was playing with her partner and 25 minutes later she asked me what procedure I was going to do... (So you don&#39;t need to take a turn?) When I told her that it was a real estate procedure, I He said I should wait for the advisor. More than obvious I would say. The last straw was when I took out my cell phone to see that I had been waiting for an hour that the lady yelled at me that the service was limited and I should put it away (but she didn&#39;t tell anyone else that) that&#39;s why I took my photos.

"Si le pudiera dar menos de una estrella, se la daría. Los ejecutivos simplemente no te quieren atender, después de decirme que ""ahorita me atendían"" me tuvieron 45 minutos sentado esperando mi turno mientras 3 de sus ejecutivos no estaban haciendo nada más que checar su celular.

En algún punto llegó uno de ellos a preguntarme qué trámite iba a hacer y si ya me estaban atendiendo, al decirle que nadie me estaba atendiendo me dijo ""ahorita te atienden"" y luego le avisó a todos sus compañeros que al rato venía porque se iba a ir a comer, sin hacer absolutamente nada para solucionar mi problema.

Después de casi una hora esperando me terminaron diciendo que en esa sucursal no se podía hacer el trámite, incluso después de preguntar sobre todos los requisitos antes de sentarme a esperar, que aparentemente solo era un comprobante de domicilio (de los cuales por cierto llevé 3 diferentes, y me dijeron que dos de ellos no contaban porque eran de celulares y de internet).

A final de cuentas me hubiera tardado menos tiempo sacando mi dinero en efectivo en ventanilla y abriendo una cuenta en otro banco que lo que me tuvieron esperando la bola de inútiles que atienden en esta sucursal.

Hoy perdieron un cliente de años.","If I could give it less than a star, I would. The executives simply don&#39;t want to serve you, after telling me that &quot;they were attending to me right now&quot; they had me sitting for 45 minutes waiting for my turn while 3 of their executives were doing nothing more than checking their cell phone. At some point one of them came to ask me what procedure I was going to do and if they were already attending to me, when I told him that no one was attending to me he told me &quot;they will attend to you right now&quot; and then he told all his colleagues that he would be coming soon because he was leaving. to go eat, without doing absolutely anything to solve my problem. After almost an hour waiting, they ended up telling me that the procedure could not be done at that branch, even after asking about all the requirements before sitting down to wait, which apparently was only proof of address (of which, by the way, I took 3 different, and they told me that two of them did not count because they were from cell phones and the internet).

"Después de más de 25 años de haber abierto cuenta finalmente la cerré. Hace más de 6 años saque casi todo mi dinero porque la atención era deficiente y ofrecían cosas que no cumplían. Por confiado no cerré la cuenta y dejé cerca de $10,000. Pensando que más adelante podrían ser una opción. A principio de año revise mi estado y casi toda la inversión se la habían comido en comisiones, jamás se comunicaron para indicarme cuando empezarían a cobrar comisiones o para decirme que autorizara el pago de nuevas comisiones. Por experiencia sabia que ese era el procedimiento: te hablaban para que fueras a pagar y así se aseguraban de que estuvieras enterado. A su conveniencia cambiaron esa política para robarse el dinero de miles de clientes. ""Acostúmbrate a ganar más"" es solo  slogan, si confías en ellos cualquier día cambian sus políticas y procedimientos y  te dejan sin nada. Más te vales leer todo su larguísimo contrato y entender todo y prevenir todo. Me arrepiento y me disculpo por de haber recomendado esta empresa en el pasado. Al parecer su verdadera vocación es que ""ellos se acostumbren a ganar más"" sin ética y sin escrúpulos y si el cliente pierde todo pues eso le pasa por confiado.","After more than 25 years of opening an account, I finally closed it. More than 6 years ago I took out almost all my money because the service was poor and they offered things that did not comply. Out of confidence I did not close the account and left about $10,000. Thinking that later they could be an option. At the beginning of the year I reviewed my status and almost all of the investment had been eaten up in commissions. They never contacted me to tell me when they would start charging commissions or to tell me to authorize the payment of new commissions. From experience I knew that this was the procedure: they talked to you so that you would pay and that way they made sure that you were aware. At their convenience they changed that policy to steal the money of thousands of clients. &quot;Get used to earning more&quot; is just a slogan, if you trust them any day they change their policies and procedures and leave you with nothing. You better read their entire very long contract and understand everything and prevent everything. I regret and apologize for recommending this company in the past. Apparently their true vocation is that &quot;they get used to earning more&quot; without ethics and without scruples and if the client loses everything, then that is what they think is trusting.",,,,,10,,,,,si,si,,,,,,,
"Respecto a mi experiencia en Actinver puedo decir unos consejos si vas a visitar la sucursal.

Tienen estacionamiento gratuito para clientes y es por la calle Rinconada de las Praderas en frente del Oxxo solo hay que decir que vienen al banco para que te den tu boleto sellado.

Respecto a la atención por ser personalizada será necesario agendar una cita previamente para no quedar esperando, pues todo se maneja de esta manera y quedarás esperando si no cuentas con ella, te atenderán pero será tardado.

Con respecto a los medios de comunicación es preferible que contactes a tu asesor por medio de correo o WhatsApp pues la lineas si se encuentran saturadas en ocasiones.

Ya hablando de los productos de inversión creo que el ser una institución regulada la vuelve sería y comprometida con los clientes pues da la seguridad de tener productos respaldados por el IPAB.

En cuanto a la asesoría, es importante mencionar que se encuentran preparados y brindan muy buen servicio, algunos procesos son lentos pero con paciencia todo se resuelve.

En resumen es un buen lugar para invertir, cuenta con muchos servicios, se debe ser paciente con el servicio telefónico y de preferencia hacer cita para no pasar un mal rato.","Regarding my experience at Actinver, I can say some advice if you are going to visit the branch. They have free parking for clients and it is on Rinconada de las Praderas street in front of the Oxxo, you just have to say that they come to the bank to give you your stamped ticket. Regarding the attention, because it is personalized, it will be necessary to schedule an appointment in advance so as not to be left waiting, since everything is handled in this way and you will be left waiting if you do not have one, they will attend to you but it will take time. Regarding the media, it is preferable that you contact your advisor by email or WhatsApp as the lines are sometimes saturated. Speaking of investment products, I believe that being a regulated institution makes it serious and committed to clients since it gives the security of having products backed by the IPAB. Regarding advice, it is important to mention that they are prepared and provide very good service, some processes are slow but with patience everything is resolved. In short, it is a good place to invest, it has many services, you should be patient with the telephone service and preferably make an appointment so as not to have a bad time.",2023-07-17,Banco Actinver,maps,Jalisco,75,Social Capital,Social External,CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT (QUALITY),CUSTOMER WELFARE,si,si,Social External,Social Capital,POSITIVE,2023.0,July,7.0,Zapopan

"¡EMPLEADOS DE BANCO AZTECA ME CLONARON LA TARJETA Y ME ROBARON 10MIL PESOS!

¡No confíes en Banco Azteca! Sus mismos empleados clonan las tarjetas que ni siquiera has activado.

En enero se me ocurrió la grandiosa idea de abrir una cuenta con Banco Azteca, ese mismo día me entregaron una tarjeta de debito en un sobre sellado, el cual nunca abrí ya que no pretendía usar dicha tarjeta. Tampoco activé nunca la tarjeta digital en su plataforma. Para lo único que usaba esa cuenta era para guardar parte de mis ahorros. Resulta que el pasado 29-Jun-2023 se realizó un cargo en línea a mi tarjeta de débito (por más de 10mil pesos) para una compra con AVIANCA-MADRID, misma compra que obviamente yo no realicé ya que ni siquiera conozco la expiración ni CCV de mi tarjeta (repito, la tarjeta aun está en el sobre sellado que me entregaron en enero). Entonces no entiendo como es posible que alguien haya clonado mi tarjeta si solo ustedes Banco Azteca tienen esos datos sensibles de mi tarjeta. Puse la reclamación y la resolución fue “No procedente” ya que según @Banco Azteca fui yo quien usó la tarjeta, cuando es obvio que no fue así. Volví a poner la reclamación y nuevamente recibí la misma resolución. Su política de protección de datos es ineficaz y se me hace una falta de ética por parte de @Banco Azteca el que no hagan nada para devolverme mi dinero. Leí reseñas en internet y veo que no soy el único cliente afectado, veo que es muy común que esto pase con @Banco Azteca, así que no confíen su dinero con este banco. Créanme que su dinero está mas protegido debajo del colchón de su habitación que en una cuenta de @Banco Azteca
.
@Banco Azteca ya puse mi reclamación en la CONDUSEF porque no voy a dejar que se queden con mi dinero, ustedes son cómplices de los ladrones que trabajan en su banco al no hacer nada para que estos casos no se sigan suscitando.","BANK AZTECA EMPLOYEES CLONED MY CARD AND STOLEN 10 THOUSAND PESOS FROM ME! Don&#39;t trust Banco Azteca! Their same employees clone the cards that you have not even activated. In January I had the great idea of opening an account with Banco Azteca, that same day they gave me a debit card in a sealed envelope, which I never opened since I did not intend to use said card. I also never activated the digital card on their platform. The only thing I used that account for was to save part of my savings. It turns out that last June 29, 2023, an online charge was made to my debit card (for more than 10 thousand pesos) for a purchase with AVIANCA-MADRID, the same purchase that I obviously did not make since I do not even know the expiration or CCV of my card (I repeat, the card is still in the sealed envelope they gave me in January). So I don&#39;t understand how it is possible that someone has cloned my card if only you Banco Azteca have those sensitive data on my card. I filed the claim and the resolution was “Not applicable” since according to @Banco Azteca I was the one who used the card, when it is obvious that this was not the case. I filed the claim again and again received the same resolution. Their data protection policy is ineffective and I think it is unethical on the part of @Banco Azteca that they do nothing to return my money. I read reviews on the internet and I see that I am not the only client affected, I see that it is very common for this to happen with @Banco Azteca, so do not trust your money with this bank. Believe me, your money is more protected under the mattress in your room than in a @Banco Azteca account. @Banco Azteca I already filed my claim with CONDUSEF because I am not going to let them keep my money, you are accomplices of the thieves who work at your bank by not doing anything so that these cases do not continue to arise.",2023-07-13,Banco Azteca,maps,Quintana Roo,5,Environment,Environmental,ENVIRONMENTAL CULTURE,WASTE & HAZARDOUS MATERIAL MANAGEMENT,si,si,Environmental,Environment,NEUTRAL,2023.0,July,7.0,Cancún

"Digitt me apoyo enormemente.

En el proceso me pidieron los mismos requisitos que las demas financieras, yo creo que creyeron en mi, acepte el compromiso de no fallarles.

Until I contacted DIGITT, with them the process was super simple, fast, the interest rate was much lower than the bank&#39;s and in 15 months I healed my debt with the bank. In the process they asked me for the same requirements as the other financiers, I believe they believed in me, I accepted the commitment not to fail them.

"MALA ATENCIÓN, FRAUDE Y ENGAÑOS
Pésima atención desde que llegas, les pedí una carátula o algo en formato digital, me dijeron que me lo enviarían y no fue así.
Pregunté por aumentar el tope de depósitos y me manejaron que para aumentar mi límite de depósitos tenía que tener un ahorro en dólares  lo cual fue completamente falso, la realidad es que me vendieron un seguro sin mi consentimiento llamado META SEGURA.
Resulta que Meta Segura es un seguro de vida que en caso de que faltes le entregan a tu beneficiario la suma asegurada, en este caso 13,000 USD, para poder recuperar tu dinero si puedes hacerlo antes del plazo que fue de 13 AÑOS solo que te entregan una parte.
En mi caso podré retirar 364 USD de los 526 USD que me quitaron y eso a partir del séptimo mes.","BAD ATTENTION, FRAUD AND DECEPTION Terrible attention from the moment you arrive, I asked them for a cover or something in digital format, they told me they would send it to me and that was not the case. I asked about increasing the deposit limit and they told me that to increase my deposit limit I had to have savings in dollars which was completely false, the reality is that they sold me insurance without my consent called META SEGURA. It turns out that Meta Segura is a life insurance that in case you are missing, they give your beneficiary the insured sum, in this case 13,000 USD, to be able to recover your money if you can do it before the period, which was 13 YEARS, only that they give you a part.

"QUIZA DEBERIAS TOMAR FOTOS DE EVIDENCIA O VIDEO ANTES DE EMPEÑAR. Es la única mala experiencia que he tenido, y espero sea  la ultima, he llevado a empeñar ya varios instrumentos y  siempre los tengo en perfecto estado ya que a eso me dedico, dos años despues de no empeñar nada esta ultima vez lleve a empeñar una guitarra de valor, que aprecio y siempre cuide mucho, solo pedi $600 y fui a recogerla unos días despues por lo que no la deje en estuche, cuando pague me entregaron la guitarra con un gran golpe en la parte posterior de la caja,raspones, la tapa estaba separada unos 2cm y el golpe despego la madera (con todo y pintura) unos 7cm, al parecer se les cayo del estante donde las colocan, obviamente reclame porque uno deberia recibir sus pertenencias como las dejo e incluso tengo evidencias de como estaba la guitarra antes de empeñarla, el asunto es que un chico amable llamado Leo me ofrecio una reparación (disque con su gerente, aunque nunca hable con el) pero yo se de antemano que son muy caras y ademas un golpe de ese tipo devalúa el instrumento, dias despues al recoger mi guitarra me di cuenta del pesimo trabajo pues solo habían rellenado el hueco y pintado con el esmalte de uñas mas parecido al color que encontraron, acepte porque no iba a dejarles mi guitarra y menos por lo que me ofrecieron pero sinceramente deberían tener mas cuidado con los artículos de los clientes, en otras ocasiones envuelven mis instrumentos en plastico que hasta dos metros les quito de encima esta vez solo traia 20cm de emplaye y sobre eso su etiqueta para ubicar los articulos, quiero agregar que una señora muy metiche defendia que desde que lleve mi instrumento ya estaba golpeado y ni aunque mostre mis pruebas pude sacarle de su idea, a lo mejor a ella se le cayo porque juraba haber revisado las camaras y dice que nunca le pasó nada al instrumento, que raro porque antes otro empleado con quien trate directamente mi asunto honestamente me dijo que no tuvieron tiempo de ver las camaras, revisen que protegan bien sus articulos","MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE PHOTOS OF EVIDENCE OR VIDEO BEFORE PAWNING. It is the only bad experience I have had, and I hope it will be the last, I have had to pawn several instruments and I always have them in perfect condition since that is what I do, two years after not pawning anything this last time I had to pawn one valuable guitar, which I appreciate and always take great care of, I only ordered $600 and I went to pick it up a few days later so I didn&#39;t leave it in the case, when I paid they delivered the guitar to me with a big dent on the back of the case, scratches, The lid was separated by about 2cm and the blow detached the wood (with everything and paint) by about 7cm. Apparently it fell from the shelf where they are placed. Obviously I complained because one should receive their belongings as they were left and I even have evidence of how they were. the guitar before pawning it, the thing is that a nice guy named Leo offered me a repair (I talked to his manager, although I never talked to him) but I know in advance that they are very expensive and also a blow of that type devalues the instrument Days later, when I picked up my guitar, I realized what a terrible job it was because they had only filled in the hole and painted it with the nail polish closest to the color they could find. I accepted because I wasn&#39;t going to leave my guitar to them, much less for what they offered me, but honestly They should be more careful with the clients&#39; items, on other occasions they wrap my instruments in plastic that I remove up to two meters from them, this time I only had 20cm of packaging and on that their label to locate the items, I want to add that a very lady The nosy person defended that since I brought my instrument it had already been damaged and even if I showed my evidence I couldn&#39;t dissuade her from her idea, maybe she dropped it because she swore she had checked the cameras and she says that nothing ever happened to the instrument, how strange because Before, another employee with whom I dealt directly with my matter honestly told me that they did not have time to see the cameras, check that they protect their items well.",,,,,15,,,,,si,si,,,,,,,

"November 4, 2023, I entered to ask if there was anyone working that day that could process my IRA contribution as the last time the banker hand to make a call to tbe walked through the steps.

Upon my return, Jocelyn did not say anything.  I did notice, however, that the female banker I had talked to was busy.  So I sat down to wait.  After a t least ten minutes, the branch manager, Gerardo (I think), sent Jocely on a break and covered for her.  After another five or six minutes, I rose and told him that I was there to make an IRA contribution.  He replied raising his voice that I would have to keep waiting because his bankers were busy.  He then asked (still in a raised voice) if I signed in.  I told him that the greeter didn't say anything to me even though she knkew why I was there and that I had been waiting over fifteen minutes.

"Muy mal servicio, en primera la única cajera que había con una actitud peor que en ek IMSS, nada servicial, se equivocó en la captura de información para un pago gubernamental y todavía dice: ""por eso no me gustan estos pagos"" como si yo tuviera la culpa de su error. Fui muuuuy paciente porque de verdad fue una persona bastante mal encarada y grosera, obvio cambié mi actitud y también dejé de ser amable con ella. El cliente no tiene la culpa de sus problemas y si no le gusta no sé que hace ahí. Además con una fuerte tos y no se tapaba la boca, hay un vidrio y protege pero avienta sus gérmenes por todos lados y a mis documentos les tosía tanto que me dio asco agarrarlos después. Mas de 20 minutos para un trámite que en otros bancos me tardan 2 minutos... Todo por querer experimentar en bancos nuevos... Pésima experiencia la de hoy.","Very bad service, first of all the only cashier there was with a worse attitude than in the IMSS, not at all helpful, she made a mistake when entering information for a government payment and still says: &quot;that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like these payments&quot; as if I was to blame for his mistake. I was very patient because she really was a very rude and rude person, obviously I changed my attitude and also stopped being nice to her. The client is not to blame for their problems and if they don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t know what they are doing there. Also, with a strong cough and he didn&#39;t cover his mouth, there is a glass and it protects but it spreads its germs everywhere and I coughed so much on my documents that it made me sick to grab them afterwards.

He turned around and walked away, I continued with my attempt to get the shift and a cashier, then I realized that she was one of 3 cashiers who were without any customers at the window, she approached me and asked me what operation I was going to perform, I repeated the information and he told me that they were not going to serve me at the cashier for the same reason, not to mention, sorry but I ignored it and waited for my turn, I approached a cashier and made the deposit of $6,520.50 without any major problem, I went to to the first assistant and I asked him for his name, Antonio Martínez, reluctantly, he told me and I asked him the name of the teller and he answered, you ask him, in the face of so much cordiality, the management came and expressed my disagreement with the bank&#39;s police procedures But, surprise, the manager told me that this is indeed the company&#39;s new policy, to cash only deposits of $25,0000.00 or more. The problem with this policy is that there is only one ATM to carry out this type of operations only with bills and at least in my case the device has been blocked 3 times and I have had to do the cumbersome claim procedure or make deposits in pauses because it does not recognize the bills or it simply does not work.....meanwhile inside there are 3 cashiers, an assistant at the access to block the service....all of them for &quot;not working, being incompetent, negligent&quot;... I don&#39;t understand or what the reason is... I hope they correct it...

"Un lugar lleno de incompetentes me hicieron perder más de 1 hora y se quedaron mi dinero, fui a realizar un pago y me dicen que no pueden darme ticket en caja así que tengo que hacerlo en cajero, el tipo que me atendió me ayudó a hacerlo así que yo no pude haberme equivocado, el cajero se trago mi dinero y no pudieron resolverme, dijeron que esperara media hora al corte de caja (que obviamente ni siquiera hicieron) al volver tras media hora me dicen que mi dinero no apareció, acabe haciendo mi pago (adivinen dónde? En caja y si me dieron ticket). Para colmo la encargada ni siquiera pudo decirme cuando podían darme solucion, que tenía que hacer una carta a mano para reclamación (todavia hacerme perder mas tiempo) mis tiempos ya no me permitían hacerla, no puedo creer que un banco como Santander que siempre me ha dado buena atención tenga gente tan incompetente, poco resolutiva y mal educada (con excepción del primero que me atendió que siempre fue amable) trabajando para ellos.

"Pésimo servicio. Ayer apenas me enteré que no puedo pasar a ventanilla a realizar un depósito si no es por más de $ 25,000.00 pesos, la srita. que me atendió en la puerta con una mala cara me dijo que solo por cajero podía hacer mi depósito. La señora que estaba en el cajero de al lado haciendo un depósito, tuvo un problema para hacerlo, según que porque no acomodó los billetes en órden y la srita.  mala cara le dijo de mala gana ""por eso le dije que acomodara sus billetes"". Total que pude hacer mi depósito pero no salió mi comprobante y entré a la sucursal para que me dieran mi comprobante. Ya dentro, la srita. se puso a atender a otra persona que llegó despues de mi y cuando le pregunté que si se iba a tardar mucho, otra vez, de mal genio y con mala cara me dijo: ¿¡me permite!?, y depués de esperar, ¡oh, sorpresa!, que tenía que meter una aclaración que se iba a resolver en 72 hrs, una aclaración como para qué. Si su máquina no tenía papel, se trabó o  lo que sea que le haya pasado, no es mi problema. El tipo que no se si era el gerente o un ejecutivo, me dijo ""solo puedo confirmarle que los fondo hayan caído en la cuenta y no podemos hacer nada más, tiene que meter su aclaración, señora"", fue cuando le dije que por eso quería pasar a ventanilla, porque necesitaba mi comprobante. Después de como 15-20 minutos adentro de la sucursal, ¡por fin! me dieron mi papel. Ojala a la srita que atiende de mala gana, Jackie, le decían, le enseñen a cómo tratar al cliente, si está cansada o harta o tuvo un mal día, que no trabaje en atención al cliente.","Terrible service. Yesterday I just found out that I cannot go to the window to make a deposit if it is not for more than $25,000.00 pesos, Ms. The person who greeted me at the door with a bad face told me that I could only make my deposit through an ATM. The lady who was at the ATM next door making a deposit had a problem doing so, apparently because she did not arrange the bills in order and the lady. &quot;That&#39;s why I told him to put his bills away,&quot; he said with a bad face. I was able to make my deposit but my receipt didn&#39;t come out and I went into the branch to get my receipt. Once inside, Ms. He began to attend to another person who arrived after me and when I asked him if it was going to take too long, again, with a bad temper and with a bad face, he said to me: May I be allowed!?, and after waiting, Oh, surprise! I had to make a clarification that was going to be resolved in 72 hours, a clarification as to why. If your machine was out of paper, jammed, or whatever happened to it, it&#39;s not my problem. The guy, who I don&#39;t know if he was the manager or an executive, told me &quot;I can only confirm that the funds have been accounted for and we can&#39;t do anything else, you have to clarify, ma&#39;am&quot;, that&#39;s when I told him that&#39;s why I wanted to go to the window, because I needed my receipt.

Si te entra una llamada en menos de 10 segundos alguien te aborda y te invitan a colgar inmediatamente o retirarte, ojalá su tiempo de tiempo de espera fuera así de rápido, si vas a ventanilla (recuerda hacer movimientos importantes no hacerlos perder su tiempo) tu tiempo de espera promedio es 10 min por folio, si vas con ejecutivo el tiempo promedio es de 45min por folio, pero también es un pésimo servicio, fui 2 veces en dos días distintos con la ejecutivo del 6 y no me soluciono nada, solo buscan excusas, prefieren buscar el como no para negarte el servicio en lugar del como si para solucionar el problema.

If you receive a call in less than 10 seconds, someone approaches you and they invite you to hang up immediately or leave, I wish their wait time was that fast, if you go to the counter (remember to make important movements so as not to waste their time) you average waiting time is 10 minutes per page, if you go with an executive the average time is 45 minutes per page, but it is also a terrible service, I went twice on two different days with the executive on 6 and nothing was solved, they just search excuses, they prefer to look for the how not to deny you the service instead of the as if to solve the problem.

"Los trabajadores no tienen profesionalidad, te ven sentado esperando y se van a su hora de comida sin haber atendido a los clientes.

"A pesar de que no me siento cómodo compartiendo mis opiniones, creo que es necesario hacerlo en esta ocasión. A lo largo de mi vida, he visitado numerosas sucursales bancarias, y lamentablemente, me veo en la obligación de advertir a otros sobre mi experiencia en esta sucursal en particular.

No recomendaría visitar esta sucursal. El servicio al cliente que experimenté aquí es, sin lugar a dudas, uno de los peores que he encontrado en un banco.

El personal, en su mayoría, se mostró grosero. No entraré en detalles personales, pero no calificaría este lugar con una sola estrella debido a que los ejecutivos fueron la excepción, tratándonos con amabilidad a mí y a otros clientes, a diferencia del resto del personal que, lamentablemente, se mostraba confrontativo y poco dispuesto a ayudar.

Entiendo que trabajar en un banco puede ser estresante, pero lo que los empleados parecen pasar por alto es que nosotros, como clientes, también tenemos nuestras preocupaciones y estrés. Lo último que deseamos es discutir con el personal del banco. Esto solo resulta en una pérdida de tiempo valioso que podríamos invertir en descansar en casa con nuestra familia, en lugar de enfrentar faltas de respeto por parte del personal.

Sin embargo, no pretendo generalizar sobre el banco Santander en su totalidad. Reconozco que todos los bancos tienen sus puntos fuertes y débiles. El problema aquí es esta sucursal en particular, está dañando significativamente la reputación de Santander y sus servicios. Si pudiera dar un consejo, evitaría esta sucursal a menos que sea absolutamente necesario. Existen otras opciones disponibles, y quizás sea mejor considerarlas antes de recurrir a este lugar.

Por último, quisiera dirigirme a los responsables de esta sucursal. Les insto amablemente a tomar medidas con respecto a la actitud de sus empleados, con la esperanza de que otros no tengan que pasar por lo mismo que experimenté.

I would not recommend visiting this branch. The customer service I experienced here is, without a doubt, some of the worst I have encountered at a bank. The staff, for the most part, were rude. I won&#39;t go into personal details, but I wouldn&#39;t rate this place with a single star because the executives were the exception, treating me and other customers with kindness, unlike the rest of the staff who, unfortunately, were confrontational and unwilling to talk. help. I understand that working in a bank can be stressful, but what employees seem to overlook is that we, as customers, have our worries and stress too. The last thing we want is to argue with bank staff. This only results in a loss of valuable time that we could invest in resting at home with our family, instead of facing disrespect from the staff. However, I do not intend to generalize about Santander Bank as a whole. I recognize that all banks have their strengths and weaknesses. The problem here is this particular branch, it is significantly damaging the reputation of Santander and its services. If I could give one piece of advice, I would avoid this branch unless absolutely necessary. There are other options available, and it may be best to consider them before resorting to this location.

"Hay un comentario con 5 estrellas de ""la gente solo escribe cuando tiene malas experiencias"" Pero he sido cliente santander en 3 ocasiones esperando esta ser la ultima porque:

Solo hay 1 ejecutivo atendiendo todo el día, si en el escritorio de la foto de otro comentario solo se turnan.

Solo hay 2 atendiendo cajas, a veces 1. Lo mas común es que en cajas hagan movimientos tardados pero también te obligan a recoger cualquier cosa que hagas con ejecutivos como recoger el plástico de la tarjeta.

Los teléfonos siempre los tienen en silencio porque nunca contestan y si estas en el sitio nunca escuchas que suenen.

Y si, hay ocasiones que tardas solo 30 min pero es porque no había mucha gente y te toco ser de los primeros lo cual hasta un reloj descompuesto acierta dos veces al día.

There are only 2 attending to the cash registers, sometimes 1.

"Personalmente leí muchos comentarios negativos respecto a esta sucursal y vine -como muchos otros- predispuesto. No puedo dejar de mencionar que como mencionan casi todos el servicio es muy lento, vengan preparados para pasar la mañana o tarde aquí para sus trámites ya que una persona es la única que atiende en la entrega de tarjetas de nómina. Yo fui a las 9am y el trámite de nómina lo terminé a las 10:36am.

Posteriormente realicé una apertura de tarjeta de crédito (me atendió Iván) donde fueron muy claros, me ayudaron con el proceso y salí totalmente satisfecho. Esto me tomó unos 30-45 minutos más. Y al final cancelé dos tarjetas de débito, cambié mi número celular de contacto y correo electrónico que tenía y no usaba y me atendiereron rápido, eficiente, de buena gana, pacientemente y muy amables en todo el proceso, eso me llevó como 30 minutos.
Si bien el servicio es lento por el poco personal que tienen, afortunadamente quienes laboran ahí son el mejor personal por el que he tenido el gusto de ser atendido en cualquier sucursal Santander. Hice muchísimos trámites y en todo momento me ayudaron, tardé dos horas y media pero creo es razonable para la cantidad de trámites que hice. Gracias","Personally, I read many negative comments regarding this branch and I came - like many others - predisposed.

I went at 9am and finished the payroll process at 10:36am. However, I had a problem with my accounts and they kindly and patiently resolved it, explained the details and even provided me with options to resolve it. Later I opened a credit card (Iván assisted me) where they were very clear, they helped me with the process and I left completely satisfied. This took me about 30-45 more minutes. And in the end I canceled two debit cards, I changed my contact cell phone number and email that I had and was not using and they assisted me quickly, efficiently, willingly, patiently and very kind throughout the entire process, that took me about 30 minutes.

"El peor servicio de cualquier sucursal de banco que he tenido en mi vida. Empezando por la hostess que no es nada organizada, no deja pasar a nadie ni entrega turnos (pese a que soy cliente) pero si sale a preguntar a cada rato si alguien es SELECT. Revisa que trámite va a realizar uno y por cuánta cantidad y lo repite en voz alta ¡¡¡CON CANTIDADES!!! Frente a toda la gente. Después se va a su mini escritorio y anota esa información en una libreta!!!!! Me pidió mostrar mi cheque, lo revisó y comunicó en voz alta lo que iba a cobrar (menos mal era para abono en cuenta) sino probablemente me asaltarian saliendo.

Continuando....obviamente al paso del tiempo la gente se desespera y pregunta que cuando puede entrar a lo que ella responde "" si quieren pasar rápido hay que pagar más y hacerse cliente Select"" lo cual vemos injusto por que somos ya clientes y no recibimos ni siquiera un turno.   Para terminar las cajeras súper lentos, todas mal encaradas.  Hasta la de la limpieza trae una cara de enojada con el mundo (y eso que ni es personal de Santander). Pero eso si, la hostess acostada en el mini escritorio de entrada.

Particularmente no vuelvo a esa sucursal en mi vida y estoy considerando quedarme con BBVA solamente ya que a pesar que siempre tienen demasiados clientes el servicio es muy amable y eficaz.","The worst service of any bank branch I have ever had in my life.

Then he goes to his mini desk and writes down that information in a notebook!!!!! He asked me to show my check, he reviewed it and communicated out loud what he was going to collect (thank goodness it was for credit into the account) otherwise I would probably be attacked leaving. Continuing....obviously as time goes by people get desperate and ask when they can get in, to which she responds &quot;if you want to get in quickly you have to pay more and become a Select customer&quot; which we see as unfair because we are already customers and not we didn&#39;t even get a turn. To finish, the super slow cashiers, all poorly faced. Even the cleaning lady looks angry at the world (and she&#39;s not even Santander staff). But yes, the hostess lying on the mini entrance desk.

"Anteriormente tenían mejor servicio y atención al cliente.

Ahora con sus nuevas “reglas” hacen trabajar doble al cliente, es una reverenda tontería que si no llevas más de $25,000.00 no te puedan depositar en cajas, como si sus cajeros tuvieran la tecnología suficiente para aceptar todo tipo de billetes e incluso monedas.

En mi caso, cuento con un negocio donde la mayor parte de mi ingreso es con monedas, por lo que es tedioso tener que tomar un turno para pasar a caja solo a cambiar el dinero para que después me saquen del banco para que yo pase al cajero a depositar.

De lo anterior, le pregunte a la cajera, del por que era la única sucursal que hacía eso, y me respondió muy tajantemente:  Pues váyase a otra sucursal. Muy mal ahí el trato al cliente, deberían capacitar mejor a su personal para saber responder de mejor manera.

In my case, I have a business where most of my income is with coins, so it is tedious to have to take a turn to go to the cashier just to change the money so that later they take me out of the bank so that I can go to the cashier to deposit.

The customer treatment there is very bad, they should train their staff better to know how to respond in a better way.

"PESIMO SERVICIO

Parece ser que las personas que trabajan allí no entienden que estan ahí para resolver problemas, pues en lugar de ayudar tienden a dirigir a los clientes hacia la línea de atención telefónica.

Si decides visitar la sucursal, aunque sea para hacer una pregunta sencilla, no esperes una respuesta rápida. Es muy probable que termines perdiendo una o dos horas de tu día esperando sin obtener respuesta.

Lamentablemente, llamar por teléfono tampoco parece ser una alternativa mejor, ya que en muchos casos simplemente no atienden la llamada. Si logras hablar con alguien, te dirigirán a otro departamento donde es probable que tampoco obtengas respuestas claras.

En resumen, el personal solo se pasa la bolita unos a otros, lo cual es demasiado molesto, pues tienen horarios muy limitados de atención como para estar perdiendo el tiempo...

Abren a las 9am, cierran a las 4 pm y durante el horario de comida se desaparece casi la mitad del personal que de entrada es muy poca gente.

Deben poner mucha más atención.","POOR SERVICE It seems that the people who work there do not understand that they are there to solve problems, because instead of helping they tend to direct customers to the hotline. If you decide to visit the branch, even to ask a simple question, don&#39;t expect a quick response. You will most likely end up wasting an hour or two of your day waiting without getting a response. Unfortunately, calling by phone does not seem to be a better alternative either, since in many cases they simply do not answer the call. If you manage to talk to someone, they will direct you to another department where you probably won&#39;t get clear answers either. In short, the staff only passes the buck to each other, which is too annoying, since they have very limited opening hours to be wasting their time... They open at 9am, they close at 4pm and during business hours When it comes to food, almost half of the staff disappears; at first there are very few people.

"Como cliente de la tienda comercial Coppel ubicada en la sucursal Juárez, al costado de la estación de Plaza Universidad en Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, mi experiencia fue realmente conveniente y agradable.

Desde el momento en que entré en la tienda, me recibió un ambiente acogedor y bien organizado. La disposición ordenada de los productos y la iluminación adecuada crearon una atmósfera agradable para explorar los diferentes departamentos y secciones.

Lo primero que noté fue la amplia variedad de productos disponibles. Desde ropa y calzado hasta electrónicos y artículos para el hogar, la tienda Coppel en esta sucursal parece tener todo lo que uno podría necesitar. Además, la gama de marcas y opciones dentro de cada categoría brinda a los clientes una gran flexibilidad para elegir lo que mejor se adapte a sus gustos y necesidades.

El personal de la tienda demostró ser amable y dispuesto a ayudar. Si tenía preguntas sobre un producto en particular o necesitaba asistencia para encontrar algo, siempre había alguien disponible para brindar orientación. Esta disposición a ayudar creó un ambiente cómodo y sin estrés para mi experiencia de compra.

La sucursal en sí estaba limpia y bien mantenida, lo que contribuyó a la sensación general de profesionalismo y atención al detalle. Los letreros y señalizaciones claras facilitaron la navegación por la tienda, y la disposición de las cajas registradoras y las áreas de servicio al cliente estaba diseñada de manera lógica.

Además, la ubicación de la tienda, al costado de la estación de Plaza Universidad, agregó un elemento de conveniencia. Fue fácil llegar en transporte público y, al estar cerca de una estación de tren, pude continuar con mi día sin problemas después de hacer mis compras.

En general, mi experiencia como cliente en la tienda Coppel sucursal Juárez fue positiva.

Additionally, the range of brands and options within each category gives customers great flexibility to choose what best suits their tastes and needs. The store staff proved to be friendly and willing to help. If I had questions about a particular product or needed assistance finding something, there was always someone available to provide guidance. This willingness to help created a comfortable and stress-free environment for my shopping experience. The branch itself was clean and well maintained, which added to the overall feeling of professionalism and attention to detail. Clear signs and signage made the store easy to navigate, and the layout of the cash registers and customer service areas was logically laid out. Additionally, the store&#39;s location, next to the Plaza Universidad station, added an element of convenience. It was easy to get to by public transport and being close to a train station, I was able to continue with my day without problems after doing my shopping. In general, my experience as a customer at the Coppel Juárez branch store was positive. The wide product selection, friendly staff, and convenient location all contributed to a satisfying shopping experience. As a customer, I felt cared for and valued, and would definitely consider returning in the future.",,,,,90,,,,,no,no,,,,,,,

"Mal servicio en el área de electrodomésticos. El día miércoles 14 de Junio del año en curso, fui a comprara una mochila, área donde me atendieron muy bien. Pero mi mamá quería que le comprar un microondas; así fuimos a esa área, vimos los productos y queríamos información de uno de ellos (no tenía el precio como los demás). Nos formamos para obtener respuesta, pero la tipa solo atendió a los que solo ella veía que ya llevaban producto para pagar o gente que veía que tenía dinero. Total, estuvimos preguntando el precio del microondas y la tipa solo decía ahorita y nos dejaba para atender a los otros que llegaban. Así que la mandé a chin$#&@-7 a su mamita y nos fuimos; le dije a mi madre hay más tiendas, déjala con sus cosas a la vieja esa.🤬😠😤🤭😁
Siempre me habían atendido muy bien, no se que pasó con esta tipa; pero si no le gusta atender parejo pues que renuncie. Y eso que iba arregladita, ahora fuera toda despeinada (imagínense).😁🤣🤣","Bad service in the appliance area. On Wednesday, June 14 of this year, I went to buy a backpack, an area where they treated me very well. But my mom wanted me to buy her a microwave; So we went to that area, we saw the products and we wanted information about one of them (it didn&#39;t have the price like the others). We lined up to get a response, but the woman only attended to those who only she saw already had products to pay for or people who she saw had money. Anyway, we were asking the price of the microwave and the woman just said right now and left us to attend to the others who arrived. So I sent her to chin$#&amp;@-7 to her mom and we left; I told my mother there are more stores, leave her with her things to that old woman.🤬😠😤🤭😁 They had always treated me very well, I don&#39;t know what happened to this girl; But if you don&#39;t like serving equally, then you should resign.

Aparte de eso, asi como llegue pedi la moto pero me la entregaron 4 horas despues. siempre que les preguntaba que onda con mi moto me decian que ya en 15 minutos la bajaban y nada.Y que creen? Mal armada. Fue un mega pedo con la marca para que me dieran una moto manejable y entrara en garantia

The wuey didn&#39;t even look at us, much less say a word. Nothing. Apart from that, as soon as I arrived I ordered the motorcycle but they delivered it to me 4 hours later. Every time I asked them what was up with my motorcycle they told me that in 15 minutes they would take it down and nothing. And what do you think? Poorly armed. It was a big deal with the brand so that they would give me a bike that was manageable and came under warranty.

"Ayer 3 de Febrero/2024, acudí a depositar algo de $ a mi tarjeta de débito pero no me lo recibió la cajera porque dijo que mi cuenta estaba bloqueada, por lo que pasé al área de atención a clientes y un ejecutivo dijo que no era posible desbloquear la cuenta, es más -me dijo- su cuenta está cancelada y lo único que puede hacer es retirar su saldo y volver a abrir otra cuenta con nosotros. Algo inusual en temas bancarios y muy raro que suceda algo así en comportamientos de tarjetas de débito, jamás había yo escuchado algo similar. Cómo verán no me pudieron solucionar mi problema, así que desde ayer BanCoppel perdió un cliente más pues les hice caso en retirar mi saldo y ya no abrí cuenta alguna con esa representación. Lástima; estábamos trabajando muy bien y hasta hoy no se saben los motivos que tuvieron para cancelarme mi cuenta. Gracias BanCoppel por sus servicios, fueron muchos años de colaboración mutua en nuestros asuntos financieros. Nos vamos a extrañar.....!!!","Yesterday, February 3, 2024, I went to deposit some $ to my debit card but the cashier did not receive it because she said that my account was blocked, so I went to the customer service area and an executive said that it was not possible to unblock the account, what&#39;s more - he told me - his account is canceled and the only thing he can do is withdraw his balance and reopen another account with us. Something unusual in banking matters and very rare for something like this to happen in debit card behavior, I had never heard anything similar. As you can see, they couldn&#39;t solve my problem, so since yesterday BanCoppel lost one more client because I listened to them in withdrawing my balance and I no longer opened an account with that representation. Pity; We were working very well and until today the reasons they had for canceling my account are not known.

"Fui a comprar unos tenis para mi hijo y un par para mi mamá, al entrar el guardia de seguridad NO  REVISÓ las bolsas,  los locker estaban llenos y había demasiada gente, el guardia comento que al salir nos revisarían las bolsas ( OJO: ESTO ES IMPORTANTE AL FINAL EXPLICO POR QUE ).
Toda la tienda estaba desordenada, zapatos regados por todos lados, algunos tenis no tenían su par ni estaban en sus cajas NO  HABIA PERSONAL que diera atención, y definitivamente no podia encontrar lo que yo buscaba, tampoco había tallas en existencia de los modelos que yo queria para mí hijo, y ni hablar del área de dama que estaba más desordenada aún. Había un trabajador quien amablemente me atendía a cómo podía mientras trataba de acomodar el desorden, el lugar estaba repleto de gente que sacaba zapatos y no los colocaba dónde debían.
Una señora que también estaba comprando estaba quejándose por qué no encontraba el par del zapato que ella quería; el empleado dijo que tal vez ya se lo Habían ROBADO ya que TODOS LOS DÍAS SE ROBAN artículos esto debido al exceso de gente que hay ahí y la falta de personal, claro.
Había otra trabajadora que estaba barriendo arrasando con las cajas que estaban en el suelo, el gerente se paseaba por los pasillos con cara de desesperación, osea todo fue un caos la final me atendí yo misma salí de ahí como 8 de la noche y entre desde la 2 de la tarde LO PEOR NO ACABA AQUI, al salir del lugar ya no estaba el guardia de seguridad que me dijo que revisaría las bolsas, solo estaba una persona de intedencia sacando la basura del bote de afuera de la salida principal, SALIMOS SIN QUE NOS REVISARAN LAS BOLSAS NI NADA NI TICKET DE COMPRA NI NADA, EN ESE MOMENTO ENTENDI POR QUE ES QUE COMENTO EL EMPLEADO QUE ROBAN!!!!

The entire store was disorganized, shoes scattered everywhere, some tennis shoes did not have their pair nor were they in their boxes. THERE WAS NO STAFF to give attention, and I definitely could not find what I was looking for, there were no sizes in stock of the models I wanted. I wanted it for my son, not to mention the lady&#39;s area that was even more messy. There was a worker who kindly helped me as best he could while I tried to clean up the mess. The place was full of people taking out shoes and not putting them where they should. A woman who was also shopping was complaining why she couldn&#39;t find the pair of shoes she wanted; The employee said that maybe it had already been STOLEN since items are stolen EVERY DAY, this is due to the excess of people there and the lack of staff, of course. There was another worker who was sweeping, destroying the boxes that were on the floor, the manager was walking through the hallways with a desperate look, I mean everything was chaos, in the end I took care of myself, I left there around 8 at night and entered from at 2 in the afternoon THE WORST DOES NOT END HERE, when I left the place the security guard who told me he would check the bags was no longer there, there was only a person from the administration taking the garbage out of the can outside the main exit, WE LEFT WITHOUT THAT THEY WILL CHECK OUR BAGS OR ANYTHING OR PURCHASE TICKET OR ANYTHING, AT THAT MOMENT I UNDERSTAND WHY THE EMPLOYEE COMMENTED THAT THEY STEAL!!!!

"Mi experiencia en Coppel Plaza Las Américas en Cancún fue decepcionante, lo que me lleva a otorgar una estrella en mi reseña. La mala atención y la actitud prepotente de los empleados dejaron mucho que desear.

Desde el momento en que ingresé a la tienda, noté una falta de interés por parte del personal en atender a los clientes. Esperaba recibir asistencia para encontrar lo que necesitaba, pero me encontré con empleados que parecían estar más interesados en charlar entre ellos que en ayudar a los compradores.

Cuando finalmente logré llamar la atención de uno de ellos, su actitud prepotente y su tono condescendiente fueron evidentes. En lugar de responder a mis preguntas de manera amable y educada, me hicieron sentir como si estuviera molestando y mi presencia no fuera bienvenida.

Además, noté una falta de conocimiento sobre los productos que apoyaron. Cuando pedí información adicional sobre un artículo en particular, el empleado no pudo proporcionar detalles básicos y parecía estar improvisando respuestas sin fundamentos.

En resumen, mi visita a Coppel Plaza Las Américas fue una experiencia frustrante y desagradable debido a la mala atención y la prepotencia de los empleados. Esperaba recibir un servicio de calidad, pero me fui sintiéndome ignorado y maltratado. No recomendaría esta tienda a otros debido a esta experiencia negativa.","My experience at Coppel Plaza Las Américas in Cancun was disappointing, which leads me to award one star in my review. The poor service and arrogant attitude of the employees left much to be desired. From the moment I entered the store, I noticed a lack of interest on the part of the staff in serving customers. I expected assistance in finding what I needed, but I encountered employees who seemed more interested in chatting with each other than helping shoppers. When I finally managed to get the attention of one of them, his overbearing attitude and condescending tone were evident. Instead of answering my questions in a friendly and polite manner, they made me feel like I was intruding and my presence was unwelcome. Additionally, I noticed a lack of knowledge about the products they supported. When I asked for additional information about a particular item, the employee was unable to provide basic details and seemed to be improvising unsubstantiated answers. In summary, my visit to Coppel Plaza Las Américas was a frustrating and unpleasant experience due to the poor service and arrogance of the employees.

"El lugar de medio pelo, el ambiente en cuanto a la música se refiere es calmado, quizás por la hora a la que fui a las 3:00pm, entonces estaba bien para poder charlar, tal vez mas tarde a la hora de la música en vivo se prenda mas, cosa que se comprende.
El servicio por parte de las meseras es un poco lento, al inicio nos atienden para que pidamos pronto, después tardan en pasar para saber si no te hace falta algo, yo creo que es para que no comas mucho del buffet, puede ser también porque no hay meseras suficientes, había solo tres meseras y no se daban abasto, eso que no había mucha gente pero ya comenzaban a llegar mas clientes.
La comida no es tan buena, la hamburguesa con carne tipo Aurrera, de esa congelada, las alitas regulares con poco aderezo pero bastas, según al principio eran 10 y solo me dieron 7, las siguientes te dan de 5 en 5. Los nachos ni los pidan, muy sosos y con muy poco queso, poco frijol, poca salsa.
Si es para matar un poco el hambre y no importa la calidad, tan solo la cantidad, es el lugar. Las bebidas con un precio regular.
Al pagar te dan la cuenta y te dicen que el servicio es aparte, piden el 15%, yo di un 10% aunque no debe ser obligatorio.
En general si corrigen el servicio al cliente, las meseras se organizan mas y cuidan a sus clientes, las alitas mejor aderezadas, la hamburguesa con mejor carne o mejor sabor, entonces sería un lugar que frecuentaría mas a menudo.","The place is average, the atmosphere in terms of music is calm, perhaps because of the time I went at 3:00 pm, so it was good to be able to chat, maybe later at the time of the music in alive it turns on more, which is understandable.

The food is not that good, the burger with Aurrera type meat, the frozen kind, the regular wings with little dressing but enough, according to the beginning there were 10 and they only gave me 7, the following ones they give you 5 at a time.

"Este bar de comida es un desastre total. La comida estaba más seca que el Sahara y sin sabor alguno. Las meseras parecían más interesadas en chismear que en atendernos. Ni un poco de amabilidad

"El servicio fue uno de los peores que me han tocado, fuimos al buffet de $99 llegamos nos dieron la mesa y la mesera nos muestra la carta y nos ofrece el mismo buffet pero más caro me parece que en $119 no lo recuerdo bien, nos dice que para ordenar debemos pedir una bebida de la carta y de pura casualidad no habían nada de cerveza de barril, ni cerveza en botella, casi casi nos obligaron a pedir caguamas o bebidas dela carta, pedimos una caguama que tenían un precio de $100 pesos, ordenados nuestros alimentos primero ordenamos boneless y tardaron 45 min en traerlos y para acabar nos traen alitas cuando a la mesera le repetimos 2 veces nuestra orden, no sé si fue una estrategia para que consumas más bebidas pero deme hizo una barbaridad, después pedimos una hamburguesa y de los ingredientes que decía solo tenía uno, la carne no estaba bien cocida, el queso frío y duro, a la hamburguesa de mi compañero le pusieron las tapas con el rabo de el jitomate y a mi la piña que llevaba se la pusieron directamente del la lata, después queramos sushi y nos dijieron que ya no había, volvimos a pedir boneless y cuando los trajeron no tenían nada de sal estaban incipidos y ya por último la mesera nos exigía el 30% de propina a lo que le dije que le daríamos aparte la propina y le dimos  solo 15% la verdad me quedé con un mal sabor de boca y no regresaría al lugar o almenos no a esta sucursal de dorada.","The service was one of the worst I have ever had, we went to the $99 buffet, we arrived and they gave us the table and the waitress showed us the menu and offered us the same buffet but more expensive, I think it was $119, I don&#39;t remember it well, she told us. To order we must order a drink from the menu and by pure chance there was no draft beer or bottled beer, they almost forced us to order loggerheads or drinks from the menu, we ordered a loggerhead that had a price of $100 pesos, After ordering our food, first we ordered boneless and it took them 45 minutes to bring them and finally they brought us wings when we repeated our order twice to the waitress, I don&#39;t know if it was a strategy to get you to consume more drinks but she did an awful lot to me, then we ordered a hamburger And of the ingredients that it said it only had one, the meat was not well cooked, the cheese was cold and hard, they put the tapas on my partner&#39;s hamburger with the stem of the tomato and they put the pineapple that was on me directly from the the can, then we wanted sushi and they told us there was no more, we asked for boneless again and when they brought them they didn&#39;t have any salt, they were incipient and finally the waitress demanded a 30% tip from us to which I told her we would give her Apart from the tip and we only gave 15%, the truth is I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and I would not return to the place or at least not to this branch of sea bream.",2024-03-14,BBVA México,maps,Ciudad de México,10,Social Capital,Social External,PAYMENT (TIMELY),CUSTOMER WELFARE,no,no,Social External,Social Capital,MIXED,2024.0,March,3.0,Ciudad de México

"Había ido una ocasión con amigos y no estuvo tan mal, pero la última vez que acudí habiendo mesas desocupadas nos sentaron hasta la esquina más escondida, y cuando llegaron una chica y su pareja notablemente extranjeros los sentaron al centro, lo dejamos pasar pero al llamar a los meseros nadie nos quería atender
Pedimos el buffet y no nos avisaron que no había sushi hasta que ya habíamos pedido las alitas.
Al llevarnos las alitas regresan a los 20 minutos a decirnos que la barra de cocina ya está por cerrar, cuando no eran ni las 8:30
La verdad el servicio dejó demasiado a desear, la comida no está tan rica, sobre todo la pizza es horrible, la masa cruda, y la cerveza estaba horrible, no estaba fría y estaba ""quemada"".
En verdad ahórrense el enojo y elijan otro restaurante","I had gone once with friends and it wasn&#39;t that bad, but the last time I went there, when there were unoccupied tables, they sat us in the most hidden corner, and when a girl and her partner arrived, notably foreigners, they sat them in the center, we let him pass but when he called Nobody wanted to serve us with the waiters. We ordered the buffet and they didn&#39;t tell us that there was no sushi until we had already ordered the wings. When they brought us the wings, they came back after 20 minutes to tell us that the kitchen bar was about to close, when it wasn&#39;t even 8:30.

"Yo he ido nada más por el buffet. Hay valet parking, aunque en si hay pocos espacios para estacionarse cerca, hay varios en la esquina pero es San Manuel.

Te asignarán una mesa, no puedes elegir. Puede que te toque una amplia, chida y cómoda o una alta con bancos altos y mesa pequeña.

El buffet ampliado cuesta 130 por persona MAS una obligatoria bebida de al menos medio litro. En promedio el litro de bebida está en 80-100 pesos (Caguama, mojitos, aguas de sabor SIN alcohol, piñas coladas etc)
De comida hay alitas, hamburguesas, sushi (Makis), pizzas individuales y hotdogs.

Así que calcula alrededor de 230 pesos por persona. (Precios de agosto 2023)

Sobre el lugar, es una temática como bar de Inglaterra digamos, the Beatles, nirvana, the doors, the strokes son bandas que dan el ambiente al lugar.
Muy rockero, pero excelente ambiente para todos, eso sí. Agradable a la vista :)

Sobre el servicio, tardaron 25 minutos en tomar mi orden aunque luego el mesero estuvo atento.
La comida tarda MUCHO en llegar, he ido varias veces y sin exagerar, siempre, siempreeee consideren que van a tardar unos 25 minutos o media hora en traerles la comida. Y unos 15-20 para las bebidas.
Creo que esa es la peor parte, esperar.

Recomiendo pedirte chingo de cosas desde un inicio para que te las traigan ""pronto""
Ya que si pides de cosa en cosa, tardará tanto que se te irá el apetito ente comida y comida.
Sobre todo si son varias personas que comen mucho. Ya le sé, y apenas llegó en caliente pido una hamburguesa, dos órdenes de alitas, dos sushis y mi caguama.

La propina la piden diciendo ""Si gusta apoyarme con el servicio"", me gusta, no me siento obligado a dejarles (Aunque siempre lo hago))

Creo que describí muy bien el lugar.
Lo recomiendo bastante para ir con tu novi@, tus amigos, familia.

Arriba está el bar ""la mojiteria"", ese está bueno si lo que buscas es tomar antes que comer.

Recomendaciones: La bebida Blue Coconut está buenísima, es muy dulce, cremosa. Todo puede ir con o sin alcohol, cómo gusten solo pidanlo.

Siempre pidan unas alitas BQQ, son dulces y todo mundo las ama. Algunas otras como mango habanero, búfalo y tal pueden sonar tentadoras pero créanme, son más que más cuesta acabarse.

Las hamburguesas tienen demasiado pan, yo les pellizco a la tapa para quitarle el exceso de pan y me entre más comida.

TODO lo que dejen a medias, se les cobra aparte. Así que no se levanta nadie hasta que se acabe toda la comida.","I only went for the buffet. There is valet parking, although there are few spaces to park nearby, there are several on the corner but it is San Manuel. They will assign you a table, you cannot choose. You may get a spacious, cool and comfortable one or a tall one with high benches and a small table. The expanded buffet costs 130 per person PLUS a mandatory drink of at least half a liter. On average, a liter of drink is 80-100 pesos (Caguama, mojitos, NON-alcoholic flavored waters, pina coladas, etc.) For food, there are wings, hamburgers, sushi (Makis), individual pizzas and hotdogs. So calculate around 230 pesos per person. (Prices from August 2023) About the place, it is a theme like a bar from England, let&#39;s say, the Beatles, nirvana, the doors, the strokes are bands that give the place the atmosphere. Very rock, but excellent atmosphere for everyone, yes. Nice to look at :) Regarding the service, it took them 25 minutes to take my order although then the waiter was attentive. The food takes a LONG time to arrive, I have been several times and without exaggeration, always, always consider that it will take about 25 minutes or half an hour for the food to be brought to you. And about 15-20 for drinks. I think that&#39;s the worst part, waiting. I recommend asking for a lot of things from the beginning so that they bring them to you &quot;soon.&quot; Because if you order one thing at a time, it will take so long that your appetite will disappear between meals. Especially if there are several people who eat a lot. I already know, and as soon as it arrived hot I ordered a hamburger, two orders of wings, two sushi and my loggerhead. They ask for the tip saying &quot;If you like to support me with the service&quot;, I like it, I don&#39;t feel obligated to leave them (Although I always do)) I think I described the place very well. I highly recommend it to go with your boyfriend, your friends, family. Upstairs is the bar &quot;la mojiteria&quot;, that is good if you are looking to drink before eating. Recommendations: The Blue Coconut drink is delicious, it is very sweet, creamy. Everything can go with or without alcohol, however you like, just ask for it. Always order some BQQ wings, they are sweet and everyone loves them. Some others like habanero mango, buffalo and such may sound tempting but believe me, they are more difficult to finish. The burgers have too much bread, I pinch the top to remove the excess bread and get more food in. EVERYTHING they leave halfway, they are charged separately.

"Aquí hay que empezar con lo bueno y terminar con lo malo, las hamburguesas muy ricas y llenadoras, las papas de buen tamaño y las cervezas todo bien como cualquier cerveza, creo no fue mucho lo bueno ya que al final es un servicio por el cual uno paga.
Lo malo, el chico que nos atendió como vio que ya estaban medio mal unos de mis amigos entregó la cuenta y estaba cobrando 100 pesos de más, dirán solo son 100 pesos pero ya es un robo y todavía quería su servicio, hasta que se le dijo que estaba cobrando de más y ya se hizo el loco que fue su error pero bueno, así es su método de robar al cliente, al final no le dejamos servicio por el acto de querer robarnos y además la forma en como lo piden como si fuera nuestra obligación, si no les gusta su trabajo sálganse, enserio, yo sé que la situación es difícil pero porque quieren abusar de otros? Porque no piden un buen pago. Mejor den siempre un buen trato sin aprovecharse del cliente, eso hablara bien de ustedes, al final la vida y Dios te recompensa, talvez no con dinero pero sí con más años de vida para la persona que más quieres🙌🏻
Ya no sean abusivos y eso de la propina va para hombres y mujeres de todos los establecimientos de comida.

"Es un lugar bien ambientado con muy mal mantenimiento, de entrada, (si es que la hostess está en la puerta), te recibe medio bien y te otorga una mesa sin darte a elegir en donde prefieres sentarte. Los meseros se sientan en la mesa de hasta atrás del lugar (junto a la barra) y el lugar queda sin servicio durante varios minutos, (con reloj en mano, pueden tardar hasta 15 min. en llevarte un refresco), la selección musical está bien (a secas), cuando tocan las bandas, el audio es muy mediocre aunque las bandas hacen un poco de esfuerzo, se escucha mal. La comida es medio buena, el problema es que cuando llega a tu mesa ya está fría.
Lo peor del lugar es que al pedir tu cuenta (que esa si llega rápido), te piden el 20% de propina.
Yo, no volvería a este lugar, ni lo recomiendo, sé que una buena parte del sueldo de los meseros, son las propinas, pero la propina equivale al servicio que se ofrece.","It is a well-appointed place with very poor maintenance, from the outset (if the hostess is at the door), she receives you half well and gives you a table without giving you the choice of where you prefer to sit.

The food is halfway good, the problem is that when it arrives at your table it is already cold. The worst thing about the place is that when you ask for your bill (it does arrive quickly), they ask for a 20% tip.

"Simplemente como consejo eviten ir. Llegamos y nos tomaron la orden después de 15 minutos, no nos importó debido a que vimos que estaban ocupados. Pedimos litros de bebidas y las ordenes. Aquí empezó todo. Tardaron más de 30 minutos en llevarnos las bebidas. Y entonces preguntamos a la mesera por la comida y dijo que se encargaría y la traería enseguida, entonces ordenamos más con la expectativa de que no tuvieramos que esperar tanto tiempo entre pedidos y nos negó esa opción. En fin vimos a la mesera traer pedidos de otras mesas que habían llegado a la par o poco después que nosotros y le volvimos a preguntar es entonces cuando nos dice, enseguida vuelvo. Vuelve con las hamburguesas, en un solo plato y nos dice enseguida les traigo platos, ese enseguida se convirtió en más de 10 minutos cuando ya habíamos acabado de comerlas porque además estaban frías, por lo que pensamos que llevaban rato hechas pero la mesera estaba despistada. Tardó otros 25 minutos en traernos otra orden y es entonces que le pregunté donde estaban las papas fritas que pedimos con las hamburguesas y nos que las pedirías a cocina, mismas que nunca llegaron. Después de casi dos horas y pocos clientes pues muchos se iban. Decidimos pedir la cuenta ( gran error no pedirla antes) la mesera tardó casi media hora y fue solo tras decirle que no teníamos más tiempo y que llamara a su capitán que fue por la cuenta. Entrega la cuenta esta vez y literalmente no se despegó de nosotros esperando incluyéramos la propina o “Servicio” como ellos le llaman. Al pagar en efectivo le dije que esperara el cambio y me preguntó de nuevo si cobraba el servicio de ahí, obviamente le dije que no. Así que una vez de nuevo regresó con el cambio estuvo ahí esperando, solo nos fuimos. Soy una persona a favor de la cultura de propinas y me gusta hacerlo cuando el mesero es atento o mínimo amable y el servicio es aceptable o lo menos que esperas ir y comer. Sin embargo el hecho de que, se molestaron por preguntar, la comida y bebidas tardó excesivamente, mencionaron agregar el “servicio” y ni siquiera expresaron que porcentaje. Porque seamos claros, servicio no hubo, y con tan poco personal, que seguramente es la razón de que muchas reseñas concuerdan en lo mismo, el lugar ha de pagarles un buen salario para no tener que contratar mas personal y en verdad ofrecer “servicio”","Just as advice, avoid going. We arrived and they took our order after 15 minutes, we didn&#39;t mind because we saw they were busy. We ordered liters of drinks and placed our orders. All started here. It took more than 30 minutes to bring us our drinks. And then we asked the waitress about the food and she said she would take care of it and bring it right away, so we ordered more with the expectation that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait so long between orders and she denied us that option. Finally we saw the waitress bring orders from other tables that had arrived at the same time or shortly after us and we asked her again, that&#39;s when she told us, I&#39;ll be right back. He comes back with the hamburgers, on a single plate and tells us I&#39;ll bring you plates right away, that immediately turned into more than 10 minutes when we had already finished eating them because they were also cold, so we thought they had been done for a while but the waitress was clueless . It took him another 25 minutes to bring us another order and that&#39;s when I asked him where the fries were that we ordered with the hamburgers and told us that you would ask the kitchen for them, which never arrived. After almost two hours and few customers, many left. We decided to ask for the bill (big mistake not asking for it before) the waitress took almost half an hour and it was only after telling her that we didn&#39;t have more time and to call her captain who went for the bill. He handed over the bill this time and literally stood by us waiting for us to include the tip or “Service” as they call it. When paying in cash I told him to wait for the change and he asked me again if I charged for the service there, obviously I told him no. So once he came back with the change he was there waiting, we just left. I&#39;m a pro-tipping culture person and I like to do it when the waiter is attentive or minimally friendly and the service is acceptable or the least you expect to go and eat. However, the fact that, they bothered to ask, the food and drinks took excessively long, they mentioned adding the “service” and did not even express what percentage. Because let&#39;s be clear, there was no service, and with so little staff, which is surely the reason why many reviews agree on the same thing, the place has to pay them a good salary so as not to have to hire more staff and actually offer “service.”",2024-06-10,BBVA México,maps,Jalisco,15,Human Capital,Social Internal,WORK-LIFE BALANCE,EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY,no,no,Social Internal,Human Capital,NEGATIVE,2024.0,June,6.0,Guadalajara

"Cuentan con una promoción de $99.00 en alitas, sushi, hamburguesas etc,  es un bufete que no es completo) ( no es como la promoción lo anuncia ).
Tardaron 1hora para atenderte entre un servicio y otro.
La hamburguesa que pedí no es carne de pollo solo son 3 pedazos de boneles fríoqs, es más el pan que ponen y una rebanada de lechuga y jitomate.
Ojo Así mismo exigen una propina del 20% apesar de un mal servicio qué dan, en especial el mesero (moreno con lentes) , muy aparte de esto  ofrecen servicio gratis de estacionamiento en el túnel.
Pero como no das la propina del 20% que exigen no te sellan el boleto.
Tuve que regresar que me pusieran el sello y la contestación fue esa que ellos así se cobran la propina, pagando uno el estacionamiento.
Cómo reclame y exigí el sello lo realizaron.
Si quieren pasar un mal rato vallan a Barclays pero eso sí les dejo como ejemplo como les tienen que sellar el boleto para que sea gratis su estacionamiento. No recomiendo el lugar por el pésimo servicio","They have a promotion of $99.00 on wings, sushi, hamburgers, etc., it is a buffet that is not complete (it is not as the promotion advertises). It took them 1 hour to serve you between one service and another. The hamburger I ordered is not chicken meat, it&#39;s just 3 pieces of cold boneles, it&#39;s more of the bread they put on it and a slice of lettuce and tomato. Be careful, they also require a 20% tip despite the poor service they provide, especially the waiter (dark-haired with glasses), apart from this they offer free parking in the tunnel. But since you don&#39;t give the 20% tip they require, they don&#39;t stamp your ticket. I had to return to have the stamp put on me and the answer was that this is how they collect the tip, paying for the parking. How I claimed and demanded the seal was done.

Cons:
- No tenían nada de cerveza de barril (en el menú si lo ofrecen)
- Las alitas vienen naturales y te traen las salsas aparte, sólo se pueden dos, si quieres un aderezo blue cheese te cuenta como salsa
- Los cocteles tienen muy poco alcohol, técnicamente es un mocktail

"En general he tenido bueno concepto de este banco, pero hoy si viví una pésima experiencia. Necesitaba reponer de manera urgente una tarjeta de débito extraviada. Lleve mi pasaporte y mi carnet de residente y aun asi la oficial que me atendio me dijo que esos documentos NO ERAN SUFICIENTES. Que tenía la via más facil era aceptando una tarjeta de crédito que tenia pre-aprobada para certificar que yo realmente era la persona de las identificaciones y asi actualizar el sistema. Desconozco si es que cada oficial de atención al cliente recibe una comisión por tarjetas de crédito aprobadas, pero es INAUDITO y fuera de lugar que la posibilidad de resolver una gestión de uno como cliente se sobrepongan los intereses del banco.

"Terrible experiencia cada que acudo a a este banco, lo cual evito a toda costa porque por sus empleados no recuerdo alguna vez que no haya salido de ahí decepcionada. Esta ocasión fue obligatorio porque la app de bancomer no sirve para nada. Intente con la nueva versión y soporte técnico en 4 ocasiones por teléfono ( cada vez con una solución distinta que no resolvió el problema así que tuve que acudir). En primera meto mi tarjeta al cajero trabado y se traga mi tarjeta...otro cliente me dice que a el le paso lo mismo y la persona que ayuda en los cajeros ya sabía y me vio intentar utilizarlo y  o comento nada. Le mencioné esto y me dijo que me relajará que me la daban en un momento ( 20min). Voy a otro cajero donde solicito ayuda a gritos a la que entrega fichas por una duda en un pago y jamás se acercó... tuve q dejar mi tarjeta puesta con gente atrás de mi para decirle que me ayude. Por fin se acerca y el pago q hice era de 12,000 pesos y ella dice que es imposible le porque solo se puede 9,000 pesos. Entonces le dije que me ayude a corroborar entonces a donde se fueron los 12000 pesos y dice que cheque en mi app....la cual recordemos que no puedo usar por eso estoy en el estúpido cajero. Dijo varias veces q seguro no se había hecho así que pedí me revisaran mis movimientos lo cual fue imposible con los ejecutivos. En fin con respuestas ofensivas como.....eso digaselo al dueño del banco....me fui habiendo perdiendo tiempo en intranquila con mi.moviimento que no podía revisar nadie , ni en la app. Hasta que tuve que llamar ( tmb perdida de tiempo larguísimo para poner números de tarjeta etc).  En fin sigo esperando resolver lo de la app con dolor de estomago de saber que tengo que volver a verlos.","Terrible experience every time I go to this bank, which I avoid at all costs because because of its employees I don&#39;t remember a time when I haven&#39;t left there disappointed. This time it was mandatory because the Bancomer app is useless. I tried the new version and technical support 4 times by phone (each time with a different solution that did not solve the problem so I had to go). First, I put my card in the stuck ATM and it swallows my card...another customer tells me that the same thing happened to him and the person who helps at the ATMs already knew and saw me try to use it, I said nothing. I mentioned this to him and he told me that it would relax me and that they would give it to me in a moment (20min). I go to another ATM where I shout for help from the person handing out tokens because of a payment question and she never came close... I had to leave my card with people behind me to tell them to help me. Finally she comes closer and the payment I made was 12,000 pesos and she says that it is impossible because you can only pay 9,000 pesos. So I told him to help me corroborate where the 12,000 pesos went and he said to check in my app... which let&#39;s remember I can&#39;t use that&#39;s why I&#39;m at the stupid ATM. He said several times that it had certainly not been done, so I asked them to review my movements, which was impossible with the executives. Anyway, with offensive responses like.....tell that to the owner of the bank....I left having wasted time worrying about my movement that no one could review, not even in the app. Until I had to call (also a very long waste of time to enter card numbers, etc.).

"Asistí a esta sucursal a finales de enero de 2024 por un problema con mi tarjeta de crédito. La señorita Lilia Carcamo se mostró muy amable y colaboradora, hasta que decliné a una promoción que me ofreció, pues ya no le dio seguimiento al problema de mi tarjeta y ahora voy para 3 meses en el extranjero sin poder usar esta tarjeta de crédito (sabiendo ella lo importante que era para mi) y sin que la puedan enviar a mi domicilio, porqué la dirección ""está mal"" o porqué se pidió el envío a sucursal.

Lo último no lo solicité y en lo primero dudo que este mal la dirección, pues ella tenia mi INE en sus manos y de ahí lo fue escribiendo, además se lo fui dictando. Seria muy preocupante que ella apuntara mal la dirección como represalia o moneda de cambio para aceptar la oferta con la cual ella se lleva una comisión y así ayudar a solucionar mi problema.

I did not request the latter and in the former I doubt that the address is wrong, since she had my INE in her hands and from there she wrote it, and I also dictated it to her.

No me respetaron mi turno digital, donde este literamente dice ""Con turno digital serás atendido lo más pronto posible, ya que tienes prioridad sobre los turnos generados en sucursal.","BBVA is not a bad bank, unfortunately sometimes (not to mention frequently) the branch has several ATMs out of service, which influences the user experience, in addition to the waiting time to go to the counter (the number of times I have requested it) it is a little long, in my cases an average of 40 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes. It is understood that the employees do their best and BBVA shows that the branch is maintained, which is why I give them 3 ⭐ Update. They did not respect my digital shift, where it literally says &quot;With a digital shift you will be attended to as soon as possible, since you have priority over the shifts generated in the branch.",2024-05-03,BBVA México,maps,Jalisco,45,Social Capital,Social Internal,WORK-LIFE BALANCE,CUSTOMER WELFARE,si,si,Social Internal,Social Capital,NEGATIVE,2024.0,May,5.0,Guadalajara

"La atención deja mucho que desear

Quien recibe a los clientes prácticamente es el único que se visualiza realiza su trabajo.

Para pasar con ejecutivos, como casi siempre solo ponen un ejecutivo para toda la sucursal, tardas una hora en que atienda el ejecutivo (quien si lo hace bien, por cierto)

Del área de cajas era lo único que se salvaba, manteniedo un regular con flujo de gente. Sin embargo, el día de hoy, después de estar perdiendo una hora esperando atención por parte del cajero, decido abandonar el banco.

Con una hora de espera, 10 clientes antes de mi turno, y un solo cajero laborando mientras el resto de sus compañeros solo se quedan mirándolo en lugar de ayudarle al cajero si tiene problemas o buscar la atención de los clientes, no merece la pena volver más a la sucursal ni para cancelar la cuenta prefiriendo otra sucursal.
Irónicamente iba a estrenar el ""beneficio"" de priority que cumplía un corte.

Lo que queda para retroalimentación si alguna vez lo leen, es que en resumen, el problema es la atención hacia los clientes, la cual es pauperrima, debido a la apatente escaces de personal que cuentan.","The attention leaves a lot to be desired. The person who receives the clients is practically the only one who sees himself doing his job. To deal with executives, as they almost always only put one executive for the entire branch, it takes an hour for the executive to attend (who does it well, by the way). The cashier area was the only thing that was saved, maintaining a regular with flow of people. However, today, after wasting an hour waiting for attention from the teller, I decide to leave the bank. With an hour of waiting, 10 customers before my turn, and a single cashier working while the rest of his colleagues just stare at him instead of helping the cashier if he has problems or seeking the customers&#39; attention, it&#39;s not worth coming back. more to the branch or to cancel the account preferring another branch. Ironically I was going to release the priority &quot;benefit&quot; that made a cut. What remains for feedback if you ever read it, is that in summary, the problem is the attention to customers, which is very poor, due to the apparent shortage of personnel they have.",2023-07-25,Citibanamex,maps,Nuevo León,15,Human Capital,Social Internal,WORK-LIFE BALANCE,EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY,si,si,Social Internal,Human Capital,NEGATIVE,2023.0,July,7.0,Monterrey

"He acudido en algunas ocasiones a este lugar, ya anteriormente en el estado de Guanajuato había trabajado comprando/vendiendo con fundación donde, entiendo que al final es a discreción del personal en la tienda la valuación y la mayor parte me pareció justa, en ambos sentidos(compra/venta) pero definitivamente aquí en Mexicali ha sido decepcionante y entiendo porque no ha tenido crecimiento, cuando no es la marca, es el modelo, que porque el artículo es usado, y de último el peor, lleve unos anillos de oro y diamantes y solo me tomaban el valor del metal, le pregunté por la valuación de los diamantes, en ese momento ya los había medido... Y me contestó la persona que no sabía si eran diamantes y desafortunadamente no contaban con el equipo para hacer la prueba y entonces para que verlos y medirlos o tal vez no es valuador?

And the person answered that he did not know if they were diamonds and unfortunately they did not have the equipment to do the test and then why see and measure them or maybe you are not an appraiser?

"Arrival – Upon arriving in Cancun, Mexico, I was surprised to find that the immigration line was long, even for US passport holders. This was unusual, as in my experience arriving at LAX International in California from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, the customs line usually moves very quickly. If it’s your first time and you booked a private/shared ride please do not stop at the rep at the beginning of the exit. They will take all your information and try to talk you into timeshares etc…Instead, keep walking till you get to the bus area. Look for the transportation company.. our was Amstar.
Departure - Our flight was scheduled for 12:15 pm with boarding at 11:35 am. We arranged a private ride through Amstar from our hotel at 9:20 am and arrived at Cancun airport with no traffic at 9:45 am. We quickly checked in using a kiosk and proceeded to the security checkpoint.
Unfortunately, they did not allow any liquids, not even ice. After going through security, we walked duty-free, but the prices didn't offer much, except for tax. I wanted to buy the Tom Ford Cherry perfume, which was priced at $250, but the same one at the duty-free store was $395, which wasn't a good price.
Initially, our gate was 67D, which was nice and cool. However, there was a gate change to 60 which was located upstairs, it was quite warm around that terminal. Like all airports, everything was quite expensive, not American prices but clearly tourist prices. For example, a burger and fries cost $20.
While I was at the convenience store waiting to buy water, I watched a girl get charged $20 for Hot Cheetos and Evian water, which seemed quite expensive, lol. Anyways, the airport was sufficient and offered a good selection of souvenir shops","Arrival – Upon arriving in Cancun, Mexico, I was surprised to find that the immigration line was long, even for US holders passports.

"This is an extremely busy airport that is literally bursting at the seams. When we landed in Cancun, the exit processing was fairly quick and efficient. Our luggage was there at the carousel almost at the same time we reached. In less than 10 minutes after we disembarked we were set to exit.

That’s when the fun began!

The airport is literally teeming with all kinds of people looking to “help” you. Most of them are cab drivers though there were also several tourist guides, hotel representatives, currency exchangers and many that we could not figure out. They are fairly aggressive and will pursue you relentlessly to get your attention. Since we do not know Spanish we could not understand most the stuff they were trying to sell, but their demeanor was quite intimidating.

We had arranged for a ride to pick us up (highly recommended), but there was confusion in terms of the pick up point. The driver had helpfully sent us a picture of where he was parked outside but that was of little help to us. We tried showing the picture to a few people in the airports but they tried steering us towards their contacts. Finally we sent the driver a picture of where we were waiting and he came by to pick us up. Later we realized why he was being so cautious. While Cancun allows for Uber, the airport taxi drivers have been known to physically attack them. This is why they act so surreptitiously.

Our departure from the airport was a lot smoother. The same Uber driver dropped us at the airport (he made us pay ahead of time to avoid any confusion at the airport). We were flying United and they had setup several self check in kiosks. We were able to complete the check-in and security clearance fairly quickly.

The departure area was literally overflowing with people. There are serval restaurants in the food court but all eating tables were occupied. We had to wait more than 30 minutes to order coffee at the Starbucks.

I hear they are opening a new airport in Tulúm and hopefully that will take away some of the crowds from here. I also hope that they implement some system to control the aggressive solicitation for incoming passengers.","This is an extremely busy airport that is literally bursting at the seams.

"I read a lot of reviews before coming here, and I was quite skeptical.
I’ve traveled a lot internationally and live in the states. My husband and I came here on a busy Saturday afternoon, expecting chaos.

Before the doors of our taxi closed, there was an airport worker by our side ready to usher us in to our line. He grabbed our bags and lead the way. This was an unexpected and pleasant surprise! We got to the front of the line in a matter of minutes and past security just as quickly! We also did not need to take our shoes off and no workers were yelling directions or treating people rudely, the way they do in the states. What a wonderful change of pace!

People were friendly, polite, professional, and efficient. The airport was also clean, and workers were keeping it maintained from the food court to the bathroom.

The only negative about coming here is the prices are high for Mexico, but this is a fancier part of Mexico so it’s the norm for the entire area.

I will happily fly into this airport anytime!","I read a lot of reviews before coming here, and I was quite skeptical. I&#39;ve traveled a lot internationally and lived in the states.

"5/20/24 This update went from 3 stars to only 1.
In reference to my previous travel experiences, I have decided to discontinue my travels to Mexico due to safety concerns. The practice of randomly selecting and inspecting carry-on luggage prior to boarding the aircraft raises doubts about the overall security measures in place. This lack of trust in the scanning process and the personnel responsible for operating the X-ray scanners compromises my sense of safety. A similar incident occurred at Queen Alia Airport in Jordan, which prompted me to cease all travel to and from that airport. I would like to provide an overview of what to expect upon arrival at Cancun International Airport. Passengers should be prepared for extensive walking distances between terminals and potentially long queues at immigration. However, if you possess a new passport equipped with a chip, you may utilize the self-service kiosks to expedite the process. After clearing immigration, you will proceed through customs, where you will have the option to self-declare that you are not carrying cigarettes or alcohol (left side) or declare otherwise (right side).As a helpful tip, it is recommended to pay the VISI Tax online prior to your arrival at the airport to save time. Additionally, please note that all transportation companies are not permitted inside the airport and will be waiting outside

BEWARE: Make sure you lock your check-in bags as my wife's was not locked, and someone went thru it and stole her jewelry!!! - take your jewelry in your carry-on.
Getting through security was quite quick, and they were telling everyone to leave their shoes on, which made it even quicker.
Once inside, we discovered the duty free was really no cheaper than buying at a store on or close to the resort.
There were quite a few places to eat but of course, like many airports, it was quite expensive, i.e., $18 CAD for a sandwich. To board our plane, we had to go outside and get on a bus which drove us to the plane. To make matters worse, it started raining pretty hard. So you're boarding a plane outside in the pouring rain.

"The resort it self did not meet our expectations. From the very beginning we had issues. After check-in we went to our assigned rooms only to find that people were already in the room that was given to us. The front desk did not believe us, so they had to send the the bellman to confirm, after confirming it took about another hour to get the room situation under control. Their advertising is also a bit deceiving. Their website promotes beautiful beaches that are not theirs, they are beaches that belong to a neighboring resort which their guest don't have access to. The resort felt really enclosed and trapped unable to go out and explore outside the resort. The prices for the parks, I thought were a bit outrageous, a park hopper at Disneyland would have been more affordable. The best part or highlight is traveling to Isla Mujeres, beautiful catamaran to and from the Island, and the Island in general is gorgeous. Definitely a learning experience and will do our homework before choosing our next trip.","The resort itself did not meet our expectations. From the very beginning we had issues. After check-in we went to our assigned rooms only to find that people were already in the room that was given to us. The front desk did not believe us, so they had to send the bellman to confirm, after confirming it took about another hour to get the room situation under control. Their advertising is also a bit deceiving. Their website promotes beautiful beaches that are not theirs, they are beaches that belong to a neighboring resort which their guests don&#39;t have access to. The resort felt really enclosed and trapped unable to go out and explore outside the resort. The prices for the parks, I thought were a bit outrageous, a park hopper at Disneyland would have been more affordable.

"Got the worst delta interviewer/security lady by terminal 3 gate C7 today around 11am-12pm, 5/23 Tuesday for my flight to New York. She was so rude and difficult to talk to.

When we were told to get some stickers for the back of our passport, she grilled me with questions that was a bit surprising, like how many people’s in my family and was there kids and how old are they, these are very basic and simple questions but what shocked me more was her attitude and tone, we’re all here for vacation and just heading home but being treated like we’re criminals? That felt really odd and my first unpleasant interaction with her.

When they started calling for boarding and people were lining up, she kept telling folks in the front to go to the side and wait by the seats (nice way of saying get out of her way) since they’re not priority. We were all still following instructions and waiting for our turn to board and she kept telling the group in front of me, “you’re last, go to the back and wait on the side” in a very condescending tone. Totally unnecessary, she could have politely directed folks to space out a bit if needed.

The other line to the left had a guy who was so much nicer and people went through without a problem, I think at some point because she was so mean, everyone moved to the other side to go in. I mean if you hate your job so much, don’t make it miserable for other people… it was so unpleasant to have to talk or interact with her.

I felt disrespected and this was probably one the worst boarding / check in process ever. Totally didn’t need that attitude from her for me or my group or anyone nearby trying to get on the plane. I traveled a lot and usually airport staff treats customers politely, so I was still processing the experience when it happened.

I like flying with delta but this experience was awful :( maybe they just have mean security in Cancun?

Everyone else was nice though except her. Almost making me want to put delta to the bottom of the list of airlines I want to fly with going forward… I seriously hope she gets better customer service training.

Thinking back, I wish I wrote down her name so I could report the feedback to delta, it was not the right way to treat customers. She was probably the meanest person we met in Cancun on this entire trip.

Bye bye Mexico!","Got the worst delta interviewer/security lady by terminal 3 gate C7 today around 11am-12pm, 5/23 Tuesday for my flight to New York. She was so rude and difficult to talk to.

"Arrival:

The airport is modern, clean and we had a positive experience with all staff we interacted with. The washrooms were clean, lining up at customs was orderly but that's all the positives we experienced with regards to arrivals. Once we were thru customs and arrived at the luggage carousel, we were told the luggage wouldn't arrive for another 45 minutes. Soon the area became filled with hundreds of people and there is no seating so everyone began to stand around watching the luggage carousel like they were waiting for Rock stars to pop out. It was more than an hour before the first suitcase rolled by, and there were big gaps where no new luggage showed up. In total, we waited almost 2 hours from exiting customs until we recovered all of our checked baggage. We also had to wait another hour on the shuttle bus to our resort as we waited for everyone else to finish collecting their luggage. Thankfully, the rest of our vacation was amazing!

Departure:

Nothing out of the ordinary, it was like any other North American airport. Staff helped at check in, check luggage, airport security was orderly and everyone was nice. Food in this airport is more expensive than others but there were a lot of choices.

Overall, if the baggage didn't take as long as it did, I would rate this airport with 5 stars, but that extra 3 hours of waiting killed off 3 stars for me.","Arrival: The airport is modern, clean and we had a positive experience with all the staff we interacted with.

"Horrible experience!
When you arrive at the airport and want to leave the premises, you will be guided to the exit. there are two different exits. one for “family and friends” and one for tourists. (Photo attached) But as a tourist you can't just use the exit for „family and friends“ because it's cordoned off and someone is standing in front of it so you can't get through. As a tourist you have to take the other exit, which leads to a large fenced parking lot. There are several taxi companies here that will force you to take a ride for outrageous prices. We paid 85 usD for a 10 min ride ( in comparison Uber costs 10-15 usd for the same distance)
Only once you have bought one can you and the taxi driver get past the barrier for „family and friends“.
Uber is not allowed to operate from the airport. So there is no other option (apart from a public bus?) than taking a taxi for these outrageous prices. But it is possible to take an Uber to the airport.
There are even announcements at the airport confirming that the taxi companies have been approved by the government.
In my opinion it’s a total tourist ripoff that is supported by the government.","Horrible experience!

"The airport is very crowded and confusing, it is hard to distinguish between official staff and conmen. We were advised by a guy wearing a uniform to take a taxi to the hotel zone which is 15 mins away from the airport.  We were told the price would be 30 USD payable by credit card.  We entered our PIN number on the display which read 30 USD but he was reluctant for us to hold the portable device so he was able to see our PIN number.  We were a bit suspicious about this so we checked our bank account when we arrived at the hotel and found a payment of £268 had been taken out.  We immediately stopped our cards, fortunately we are returning to the UK so this wasn’t too inconvenient.  The “taxi” was a red unmarked shown in the photo.  We reported to the police but they weren’t helpful (there was also several police officers in the area when the guy was operating). If you are in this situation only pay CASH to avoid being scammed and exercise caution.  We had left it too late to book a pickup online (you need 24 hours notice) but this would be the best option","The airport is very crowded and confusing, it is hard to distinguish between official staff and men.

"Tried to take my prescription medication from me and it wasn’t even over 3 ounces.  I have to take a prescription in gel form.  I’ll admit that it comes in a deceptively large “bottle” for reasons that aren’t clear to me.  But it is clearly labeled “Prescription Only”.  It also is not even 3 ounces.  There is actually a foil pack in the bottle (picture a Capri Sun pouch) and then a pump, that maintains a vacuum so that each actuation is accurate and so there is very little waste.  I had to end up showing them my personal medical records online to finally get them to let me have it.  As a socially anxious person, this was all somewhat traumatic and very much has me questioning my desire to travel through a Mexico airport again.  I’ve been questioned in US airports too, but they always quickly relent the second they see it says “Prescription only”.  Abraham Gonzalez was the agent.  If an airport official reads this, I encourage you to review any video you have.  Clearly your agents need better training.  I have to wonder if this wasn’t an attempt at outright theft to be honest as the medication certainly has a strong black market attraction.

В моей сумке была маленькая бутылочка с водой, ее не вытащили, а просто сняли с ленты контейнер с моей сумкой и небрежно поставили на высокую стойку, ничего не объясняя.

"Airport is not bad, but…

Beware (!!!!!) of agents at the airport exit! They introduce themselves as authorized by the airport, but in fact, under the guise of a favorable offer for an active holiday (in our case, dolphins) for a low price (payment right there!) they lure you into a timeshare/membership presentation promising free food and drinks. They say that it will take 1.5 hours, but in reality they keep you for 3-4 hours. If you are with children, this is only to their advantage - children are tired and parents already agree to everything - at least a timeshare, at least a membership for 100 weeks in advance. If you continue to refuse, expect rude communication. Refunds for activities will also take several hours and communication with employees. In our case, it was membership in Moon Palace. Having sensed something was wrong, we did not go anywhere. The agent on the phone tried to entice us in every way. Realizing that there was no result, he simply stopped answering. We managed to get the money back through the bank by disputing the transaction. Be firm and walk past such agents at the airport with a stone face and looking only forward! Don't let them check your passport or start talking to you! Also, take care of a taxi in advance! Outside the airport you will be attacked like a flock of seagulls (very noisy and screaming) they will tell you the price is about $100, in reality it costs $30-40 maximum.

"Primero que nada el guardia atento y amable no hay problema con eso

Pero tanto el personal como las instalaciones dejan mucho que desear
El tiempo de espera es demasiado me tocó ver cómo varias personas que ya tenían más tiempo que yo se iban solo había dos ejecutiv@s atendiendo (tenemos conciencia que hay procesos que llevan más tiempo) había más personal del banco pero honestamente no se cual era su papel solo estaban platicando otros en el celular

El poco personal que labora recomendaría más capacitación ya que en ocasiones se notaba falta de conocimiento en la continuación de procesos constantemente se cuestionaban en que seguia después de esto y después de aquello

A los equipos e instalaciones urgente una remodelación las luces se apagaban de repente, las computadoras demasiado lentas cada rato perdían conexión
Las oficinas de los ejecutivos, el plástico que los divide ya es demasiado viejo

Y más organización e innovación en sus métodos ya que muchos bancos manejan el registro digital como llegas y a lo que vas te dan un turno aquí tienes que anotarte en una lista
El guardia si les hace un favor, pero cuando no está mucha gente llega se registra y a veces solo iban por algo simple como un depósito pero ya perdieron tiempo por falta de personal que si hay pero no sé ven
Las cajeras bien solo fue una que parace que no tenía ganas de estar ahí

Fueron dos horas ahí que en otros bancos he hecho un proceso igual y no pasa de 10-15 min aproximadamente

No pensé que muchas reseñas de aquí fueran verdad pero ya veo que van de mal en peor","First of all, the guard is attentive and friendly, there is no problem with that. But both the staff and the facilities leave a lot to be desired. The waiting time is too long. I had to see how several people who had already been there longer than me were leaving. There were only two executives. s attending (we are aware that there are processes that take longer) there were more bank staff but I honestly don&#39;t know what their role was, only others were talking on the cell phone. The few staff that work would recommend more training since sometimes a lack of knowledge was noticeable. In the continuation of processes, they constantly questioned what was next after this and after that. The equipment and facilities needed a remodel, the lights suddenly went out, the computers that were too slow would lose connection every so often. The executives&#39; offices, the plastic that divides them is already too old And more organization and innovation in their methods since many banks manage the digital registration how you arrive and what you go they give you a turn here you have to sign up on a list The guard does do them a favor, but when not There are a lot of people who arrive and register and sometimes they only went for something simple like a deposit but they already lost time due to lack of staff, which there is but I don&#39;t know, see. The cashiers, well, it was just one who didn&#39;t seem to want to be there. It was two hours there. In other banks I have done the same process and it takes approximately 10-15 minutes.
