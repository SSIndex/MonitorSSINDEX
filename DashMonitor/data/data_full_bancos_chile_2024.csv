"The owner of this bank is the opposite of King Midas: what he touches, he turns into...

Nowadays, this bank is terrible overall. The executives' service is harmful to the clients' interests: they don't respond to emails, take an eternity to reply, apply usurious exchange rates, don't cash checks using formal excuses of mismatched signatures when that's not the case, and the teller service is slow (10 tellers and only two are open). They do everything to harm the clients.

Since Quiñenco took over the bank, the quality of service and attention has plummeted. Terrible and expensive bank. I do not recommend it for any banking products.

It's so bad that now they are focusing their advertising on the Fan Account to attract inexperienced young people as new clients, because they already know that older individuals are aware that this bank is terrible.

"Today, Wednesday, November 15th at 09:45, I went to this branch to make a cash deposit at the Providencia 1912 branch in Santiago.
It's been years since I entered a bank, let alone made a cash deposit. The bank was completely empty in the teller area; I took a number and filled out the ticket. While I was completing the document, my number was called. Another lady came to the same teller. Meanwhile, the staff at the other two tellers were chatting cheerfully. I waited for the lady to finish her transaction, then approached the teller that matched my number. When I handed in the deposit, without even greeting me, the teller scolded me for not having the ticket ready before I was called. I pointed out again, the empty bank. Just the tellers, a guard, and myself.
It's regrettable how the customers are treated; I have been a customer of this bank for 26 years. I always go to the Seminario branch, where I am treated like family.
The manners and attitude of teller number 4 at this branch are regrettable.
I write this here so that you can choose your employees more wisely. I didn't want to deposit at the ATM because the place was empty.
A bad start to the day thanks to a person who doesn't do their job of serving people properly.

"As otros comentarios han señalado, el anfitrión Fabian es fenomenal, ¡definitivamente un 5+! Él trabaja muy duro para hacer que tu estadía sea la mejor posible. Ofrece un servicio de lavandería muy razonable y tiene comida básica durante todo el día para los huéspedes. Proporciona traslados a la ciudad u otras ubicaciones cercanas, ubicaciones más alejadas pueden conllevar una pequeña tarifa, pero dudo que haya una mejor oferta disponible. También fue de gran ayuda al proporcionar una gran cantidad de información sobre la zona local; disfrutamos mucho conocer a Fabian y quedarnos con él.

Realmente quería darle a Fabian 5 estrellas, pero para ser justos, elegí darle 4 porque su ubicación está un poco alejada del área principal de la ciudad y la casa es un poco más antigua. ¡Sin embargo, las habitaciones todavía eran muy agradables y recomiendo encarecidamente este hostal!",J.P.

"¡Lugar increíble para explorar Punta Arenas y más allá! El anfitrión - Fabián - es súper servicial y amable, una de las mejores experiencias que he tenido.

El lugar tiene una sólida vibra clásica, habitaciones grandes con baño propio (cálidas y tranquilas), mucho espacio para tus cosas. La cocina compartida está bien equipada. Siempre hay fruta fresca y aguacates en la pequeña cocina de arriba, ¡mejor que lo que obtienes en hoteles de lujo!

¡Una oferta increíble por el precio!

Transporte: Fabián ha ofrecido un carro para ir al centro, pero hay convenientes conexiones de autobús (líneas 1, 6, 9, usa la aplicación Moovit, CLP 330) y taxis colectivos (CLP 600). Caminar toma alrededor de 25 minutos.

"Terrible customer service. We have moved overseas and specifically had a meeting with Chase before leaving, making sure there would be no issues once we were in a different country. Our particular concern was that there would be a way to communicate other than phone, as this costs us long-distance charges now that we are not in the USA. After a week of being here, our cards started getting declined. We also received a fraud alert when making a purchase, and even after we selected ""yes - this was me"" it still would not work. THANKFULLY we also have cards with USAA or we would have had no money in a foreign country. It has been 3 weeks and I have talked to 12 people and been on the phone for hours (at my cost) and I still have no answers. The amount of work and persistence that this has required on my end is astonishing. We already have so much on our plate and so many other issues that go along with an international move, Chase has just made everything so much more stressful and difficult. Today I was hung up on TWICE while being ""transferred"".

This happened on July 9th. I spoke with the agent but they did not provide any solution.
So, I call on whoever should solve this problem to take care of the elderly, as most of us have health problems and many do not know how to use technology. Now, for this population, in the city of La Serena, there are three branches, aren't they too few? That's what I found.

I paid that debt and immediately asked to have my cards cancelled for security reasons, but they never closed my card. Now they are charging me for the maintenance of the card that I'm supposedly in arrears for. I informed them at the time to cancel my cards, and besides having to pay for the scam, I now have to pay for the maintenance. I won't pay anything because I asked for help at the bank and no one assisted me. The charges keep increasing due to the maintenance fees. I want you to help me clear this maintenance debt because it's not mine; I never used my card and was never delinquent with payments. I always kept my debts in order and paid before the due dates.

"We went to buy at Totus in La Serena. Everything was going well until we wanted to buy a TV, at which point the cashier asked me in a very rude way to go look for the code. When I took a photo of it, it came out blurry, so she asked me to go take it again. When that also didn't turn out well, she asked another person to go find the code needed for the TV. The cashier got furious and a young man appeared, calling us dumb and criminals. I was concerned about protecting the cashier because, according to him, we were going to harm her. All we wanted was to complete our purchase, take the TV and leave. In fact, we had already paid for everything, which amounted to a purchase of 400,000 pesos.

It was a very unpleasant experience; we wasted two hours and had to go to another supermarket with our children waiting at home for lunch. We have never been treated like criminals in any other supermarket before. The young man was mocking and treated us poorly. In the end, we left without buying anything, deciding to try to understand and not to purchase because it was not right. When one goes to a supermarket, it is to fulfill a basic need for shopping, not to be treated poorly. No other supermarkets were open at the time, so we decided to stay there, thinking that since Totus belongs to Falabella, we would be treated better.

"Friendly staff, they assist until 8:00 pm. However, I am giving only 1 star because they have few staff members for the amount of people that come in. In general, CMR leaves a lot to be desired as a company, since in the face of blocks or procedures, they force you to go to the branch, while other cards only require a phone call, as is the case with Cencosud and Santander. But the worst part was that they changed my account that had a credit limit of over 1 million to one of 100,000, and they added insurance without my consent, charging it to the card, and on top of that it has a commission of around 4,500 pesos 🙀 If I hadn't noticed, they would have been charging me 5,000 pesos every month without me knowing. Furthermore, I haven't been able to go back to the branch because I don't even live in San Fernando, I had to travel to handle the procedure and now I don't have time to return.

"Awful service from the investment executive. They have you waiting for hours while they engage in pleasant chat.

Is it right for me to sue the bank and for the executive to face consequences? I make this public so that people in Quillota can assert their complaints because I am not the only one.

"I consider the bank to be very bureaucratic and not very optimized. They make cumbersome procedures that are easy in other financial institutions. Some aspects that bothered me were:

- The need to go to a branch to withdraw your physical card. In other banks, they agree to send it to your address.
- The incorrect information provided by the call center that does not match what is said at the branch.
- The use of an external app to create your pin (Keypass) and consequently, the difficulties of not having an ATM code because you don't have the physical card.
- Additionally, this ""security"" requirement does not allow you to see the data of the digital debit card, therefore, the deadlines do not match to take advantage of the opening promotion.
- The waiting time is extensive and the branches are not comfortable to wait in. After being at Scotiabank, I went to Santander for another procedure, and the wait was less than 8 minutes in a room with comfortable seating and a good aroma. On the contrary, both Scotiabank branches I visited had a sewage smell.
- The customer service at Scotiabank is not very good. In the first branch, a gentleman attended me who interrupted me while speaking and sarcastically told me, ""Go to another branch where you will have an hour and a half wait."" He knew it was my first interaction with the bank, and with that treatment, I felt it was a bad decision to open an account here.
- The second girl who attended me at the other branch was friendly but couldn't even provide me with basic information about the products, such as whether the maintenance of the credit card depended on its use. Additionally, she redirected me to an executive who was supposed to be associated with my virtual branch. She did not provide me with any contact information; however, the officer next to her did provide that information to his client.
- The digital opening process is impractical since the biometrics platform constantly fails.
- At the end of my first visit to Scotiabank, I could not log back into my virtual branch and I still don't understand the reason. The girl at the second branch told me that I would have to wait 4 business days to have my physical card and then be able to regain access to my virtual branch.

"The attention at this branch of Banco Scothiabank in San Antonio in Santiago Centro was terrible. I took a few minutes off work to cash a money order and they asked for my ID as usual. However, the lady told me that the chip was damaged and that I had to get a new ID card, knowing all the bureaucracy that involves. Why couldn't she use other methods or show some common sense and empathy? I only needed to cash $40,000, which my employer accidentally paid to that bank. 

The lack of judgment and unwillingness of the lady made me waste time and hours of work.

If the focus of the bank is on the customer, they should start by having their executives respond to emails or different customer requirements since, according to the economic scenario, this could be of great help to everyone’s pocket.

"I consider the bank to be very bureaucratic and not very optimized. They make cumbersome procedures that are easy in other financial institutions. Some aspects that bothered me were:

-The need to go to a branch to pick up your physical card. In other banks, they agree to send it to your home.
-The incorrect information given by the call center that does not match what is said at the branch.
-The use of an external app to create your pin (Keypass) and consequently, the difficulties of not having an ATM code for not having the physical card.
-Additionally, this ""security"" requirement does not allow you to see the data of the digital debit card, therefore, the deadlines do not match to take advantage of the opening promotion.
-The waiting times are long and the branches are not comfortable to wait in. After being at Scotiabank, I went to Santander to do another procedure, and the wait was less than 8 minutes in a room with comfortable seats and a good aroma. On the contrary, both Scotiabank branches I visited had a sewer smell.
-The service of the employees at Scotiabank is not very good. In the first branch, a gentleman attended me who interrupted me while speaking and in response to my problem sarcastically said, ""Go to another branch where you will have an hour and a half wait."" He knew it was my first approach with the bank and with that treatment, I felt it was a bad decision to open an account here.
-The second girl who attended me at the other branch was friendly but could not even provide me with basic information about the products, such as whether the credit card maintenance depended on its use. Additionally, she referred me to an executive who should be associated with my virtual branch. She did not provide me with any contact information, however, the employee next to her did provide that information to his client.
-The digital opening process is impractical since the biometrics platform constantly fails.
-At the end of my first visit to Scotiabank, I was unable to log back into my virtual branch and I still do not understand the reason. The girl from the second branch told me that I will have to wait 4 business days to have my physical card and thus be able to regain access to my virtual branch.

I returned the next day, Jorge was busy, so I went back to Mrs. Paola who initially had a bad attitude of superiority and a bad temper to work with the public.

"Horrible, over a month ago I bought a product online, it came defective. Two days later, I went to exchange it but they denied it because it had to go to technical service. Since then, it was supposed to take 15 business days for my product to be ready, and it has been over a month without any response.
