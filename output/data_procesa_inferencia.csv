"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Few weeks ago i was scrolling through and reading posts in review just like you're doing now, i had no intention of investing a penny in Bitcoin platform. i just enjoyed reading testimonies of different people making thousands of dollars in Bitcoin investment, it all seem like a play, it was just too good to be true.. Then i thought to myself, what if this is it? what if this is my only way of earning without having to work all day and night-shifts. I took a bold step to invest with MRS LOYCE GREEN who i've read so much good reports about. i invested $1000 as risk in his Bitcoins investment service and in 7days i got $9200 in my bitcoin wallet. from there on i realized i've been a coward all this time who was afraid of taking the leap of faith, thank God did sooner rather than later. MRS LOYCE GREEN you are so greateful and trusted. You too can be a testimony today and you can make good profit too.

"In the 3 years I’ve been using Fairfield county bank I have had nothing but a horrible experience.  Their customer service is atrocious. The absolute worst bank to use if you own a small business by far.  All they do is look for any way possible to charge you their ridiculous fees over and over. As a small business, just me, it takes time to get invoices submitted to customers as I’m out working every day than need to do the billing myself.  The amount of fees I’ve paid in the three years is insane not to mention they love those $10 daily negative balance charges while checks are processing for payment.  They don’t even have the curtesy to answer emails.  I sent a email to the manager of New Canaan Ave branch, Isaac Walcott, to never hear back plus a follow up asking about it to no response.  I would never recommend this bank to anyone, especially if you run a small business",05/20/2023 10:31:48,Fairfield County Bank,facebook,5,NEGATIVE,0.000445976271294,0.9992220401763916,0.0002679424942471,6.405939348042011e-05,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

"Three years ago we set up a savings account for our 12 year old son. We deposited $200 and even turned down any debit cards saying it was strictly for saving. Today we closed the account that had $8 left in it. The rest had been taken by the bank in ""dormancy fees"". We had started the account to hopefully show the benefits of saving money to our son.

the agent I was assigned to for my mortgage was the most unprofessional and disrespectful bank agents I have ever seen. the first few encounters he seemed friendly. but he became very rude on the phone when I called him regarding a house we wanted to purchase on a holiday. this was part of his job to respond to clients on that holiday but he acted as if I was abusing him. in the last call that day he literally started yelling like a maniac and said I was using him and that I was wasting his time. in the end he said he would send me the letter but he didn't want to hear from me again and hung up. I was in shock how a bank agent treats customers like that. later I heard he is well known to be cranky but that definitely does not make the bank look good. I switched to a different bank the same day and found a very professional agent who helped me and we actually got a mortgage with a lower interest rate. make sure you shop around and think twice before choosing this bank for mortgage.,07/10/2021 16:09:31,Citizens Bank,maps,21,NEGATIVE,0.0287679228931665,0.916588306427002,0.0348899774253368,0.019753735512495,POSITIVE,Social External,1,Social External

"We have been a customer since 2013. Our company has multiple business accounts and we also have several personal accounts. We actually switched our accounts to Fairfield County Bank, because we had received such great service from the Bridgeport branch manager Mrs. Odette Batista at our previous bank. We just had to follow her when to Fairfield County Bank and we couldn't be more pleased with the service we have always received from her. Each and every person, I have had the pleasure to work with at the Bridgeport branch and especially Veronica Foncello has been very courteous, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Such service is very hard to find in the banking industry, where most of us feel like a number.

"I never complain online but felt it only necessary to do this today.Please keep in mind that I have been with FFD County Bank since the late 90’s and have my paycheck directly deposited to a account with them. I went  to the Bridgeport branch to get some temporary  checks made. I’m out of checks. I only write approximately 20 some odd checks a year from this account and really don’t want to order 100 or so checks.I asked them to print me some checks while parked at the drive up window. I was asked to please come inside. This I did. First County bank will do this whenever I need it at the window, never a problem and totally uneventful at any branch. Not with the Bridgeport Ffc bank. Their business came to a complete stop with my asking for some checks.
There were no customers whatsoever in the bank other than myself.The tone set here was like dealing with a bureaucracy who only wants to tell you NO simply because they can say NO. Not unlike a DMV joke. After three tellers and or managers or whatever they were teaming up against me behind their bulletproof window to equally support their position of telling me NO and that I have to order checks In order to get this otherwise act of goodwill. After my complaing and rejecting their request, they finally gave in and printed up THREE  free checks.This took all of 20 seconds to print the checks. It SEEMED to be a very very difficult task for them. I would suggest they charge me per check, that would be fair. Not here, it became an act of Congress and a very unpleasant experience for something so simple. It’s was very petty and wrong.
Customer service should be happy and nice and accommodating. Please print the checks with the suggestion of ordering more checks. It only took 20 seconds to print the checks, I can’t stress that enough, twenty seconds. And this was only  once someone decided to stop resisting taking care of a customer. It did take them three people to tell me no and fill out the free check ledger that I had to sign.
I am in customer service and have learned that telling my customers no or trying to teach them a lesson simply does not work, it does not get me more customers. It is a must that I go out of my way to accommodate my client in order to keep their business.
I will say that in the past whenever working with the  Norwalk office on new Canaan Avenue, they have always been great and very accommodating and appreciative of my business. Or so it seems to me. Gail Who is in Norwalk is always very understanding and has gone the extra steps several times in the recent past for me when in fact she did not have to.I did not have to beg her or persuade her she simply took care of me. I appreciate her very much and don’t know why the Bridgeport branch would be run any differently.",09/25/2018 17:28:08,Ion Bank,maps,9,NEGATIVE,0.1147949993610382,0.4312157332897186,0.2535129189491272,0.2004762887954712,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

"I have been a customer of this bank for many years. I am surprised to see the negative comments here. Having worked with the public for many years myself, I would like to suggest something to those who are not satisfied.  When you approach someone, do so with a smile on your face.  Say ""hello, how are you today?"" before you tell them what you need them to do for you.  They are there to help you.  Just try it and see what happens.  No one wants to be greeted  with a demanding approach.  Do you?  Take this suggestion in the manner it is intended. This is also a good thing to do when calling on the phone.  I find that many times it is a
surprised reaction when I greet them in this way before I explain what I need from them.  I am not  downing  anyone. We all have bad days and personal struggles.  So does the staff.  If you have a problem, remember that they did not create it but will help you solve it or suggest what can be done.  In these hard times it is especially important that we remember that we are all in this together.

"I have had First County  Bank since I was a baby and my parents open this account. I am now 29 years old so I have had it for some time.
I moved 6 and a half years ago to another state but kept the account open and active for loyalty reasons. However I came to find out that they changed their policy and was charging me fees for months without knowing. When I called to try to get the fee's back they refused and said they would refund me 34 dollars. It was over 300 dollars of fees they charged me. They then never sent me the check and I followed up multiple times with no answer. I then closed the bank account. They then continue to charge me overdraft fees for an account I closed! I called and now they will only refund me 24 dollars and are officially closing my account.

Horrible for business accounts. If you use the debit card then that counts towards your daily usage so you can no longer withdraw funds from the ATM after you use a purchase in a store unacceptable for a business as far as I'm concerned. Can't use the debit card at the gas pump because it flags it for some type of fraud protection it's really just an all-around bad experience we'll be changing back to Bank of America.,04/07/2021 22:21:55,Dime Bank,maps,3,NEGATIVE,9.679373033577576e-05,0.99904602766037,0.0008472225745208,9.882163794827648e-06,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Social External

Horrible experience as well I agree with the customer that spoke up about poor customer service. I contact my loan officer for a mortgage. He doesn’t answer the phone so then I text and email. I’ll ask a three to four part question because I’m a first time home buyer and have questions. He’ll respond exactly a week later with the shortest amount of words possible and misspell half his words which does t make any sense. Then he’ll respond to one out of my four questions. Which frustrates me. I also agree with the loss of paperwork. The paperwork I sent he claim to never received them. Till I contact the manager and she finds them in one minute. Now I’m advised to email both parties. But this happens more times than one or two and the manager is constantly making excuses for him! This will be the last time I deal with this bank and I will tell all my friends and family to stay away. In addition I email these two individuals about the conditions of my paperwork so I can make closing deadline and three emails in no response. I agree 100 and 10 percent with the review on poor customer service and when the bank responds how can they make this better…. Get new employees who care about there job. I’m sick and tired of corporate America protecting there own and making excuses anyone can clearly see these individuals don’t care. If I’m challenged on this I will post all my emails and responses and every potential customer will see. If I lose this deal due to the bank I’m going to seek funds of the money I invested.

"Update - Jul 2020: upon hearing of the displeasure with my service, the branch manager reached out to our family to personally apologize and connect with us. The issue was resolved quickly and is imagine this is the service everyone is familiar with in banking with this branch. If you’re local, don’t hesitate to check out this bank.

Very unhappy with the service from this branch. Our family is working with this branch to handle finances from our late Uncle. As if dealing with the grief from his passing wasn’t hard enough, we are having to go through extra work to get our inheritance from this bank.

It’s been very difficult to work with them from afar - My family being in Maryland and myself in California. Twice we’ve received bank checks without being signed, at which time we’ve had to send them back for re-issuing.

Would not recommend this bank unless you live local and can proofread every document you receive from them in person— to save yourself the time.

Update: I’ve moved this up to 3 stars as upon seeing this review, the bank quickly course corrected with a sincere apology!! That’s good cuestiones service.

"In the 3 years I’ve been using Fairfield county bank I have had nothing but a horrible experience.  Their customer service is atrocious. The absolute worst bank to use if you own a small business by far.  All they do is look for any way possible to charge you their ridiculous fees over and over. As a small business, just me, it takes time to get invoices submitted to customers as I’m out working every day than need to do the billing myself.  The amount of fees I’ve paid in the three years is insane not to mention they love those $10 daily negative balance charges while checks are processing for payment.  They don’t even have the curtesy to answer emails.  I sent a email to the manager of New Canaan Ave branch, Isaac Walcott, to never hear back plus a follow up asking about it to no response.  I would never recommend this bank to anyone, especially if you run a small business",05/20/2023 10:28:02,Citizens Bank,maps,21,NEGATIVE,0.000445976271294,0.9992220401763916,0.0002679424942471,6.405939348042011e-05,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

"I have yet to go to any of the Milford Bank branches and ever have any issues. However, I use the Stratford location mainly. Matt has helped me on multiple occasions. He always looks out for my best interest and is quick to respond on any task. He is great to work with and easy to trust with your money or investment. The rest of the staff is also very kind and helpful as well. Milford Bank is growing and evolving, but they constantly prove they still care about their customers (small or big) and maintain good relationships with them unlike other banks.

"One word... lazy. I came in looking for copies of statements, as I have done many times in the past at other branches.

"After attempting to use the ATM and suffering through the $3 service charge, the ATM here has a locking mechanism that does not allow you to immediately take back your card; an increasingly common and inconvenient aspect in bank ATMs nowadays. My displeasure of having to pay $3 to remove 20 from my own account with a local bank, I have course forgot my ATM card in the Locking device.

2 hours later Upon returning when I realized I was without my ATM card, I went into the bank to claim it providing photo ID, and was probably told that for my own security my card was destroyed because a kind citizen had done the right thing and returned it. So, the policy of this bank is when somebody does the right thing, and then someone comes to claim their property with the proper ID within an extraordinarily reasonable amount of time, we're going to overly complicate your day by destroying the thing you rely upon for your business.

Thanks for making what would have been a simple problem substantially more difficult, and more time consuming.

I neglected to patronize your bank in the past for several reasons. I will add this one to the list as to why, despite being surrounded by this institution, I refuse to keep my money with them.

"This branch is down the street from my office, and I always regret going there despite the convenience.

The branch has no lobby ATM, so if the drive-through one is out of service (as it sometimes is) you either have to go inside and fill out a slip to make a checking account withdrawal or, if it's after hours, find yourself out of luck.

When I set up a business account here, the manager misspelled the name of my company and didn't enroll me in e-statements, prompting a 20-minute call to customer service to reverse the paper statement charges.

This branch doesn't have a change machine. Bank staff will instead request that you roll all your change for processing -- something I haven't done since the turn of the millennium.

"I am incredibly disappointed with Newtown Savings Bank. I started a refinance in February 2013, and it has been nothing but frustrations since.

Here are some of the issues I have with Newtown bank:

- Sent me multiple GFEs & Truth in Lending Docs with the wrong terms (I asked for a 20yr loan, and kept getting a 30yr)
- Not accepting anything but a voided check in order to do direct deposit. I even got a letter head from my previous bank stating my routing / account number but wasn't informed that was not good enough till a day before my closing.
- Doubling a coupon book fee. Because of their ""new"" system I was charged twice for a coupon book fee. They didn't tell me though,  I had to ask why my charge was suddenly higher to get it removed.
- Having two different monthly payments displayed between my commitment letter and truth in lending document. Why would they send me information that displayed two different estimates? Clearly no one read the documents before sending them out.
- Mysterious additional charges onto my origination fees. Thought origination fees are not suppose to change? Well not at Newtown Bank if you don't read correctly you may be paying extra for nothing.
- Requiring me to change my deductible on my homeowners insurance to $1000, literally 4 hours before my closing. It's one thing to tell me that your bank has a maximum deductible requirement. It's a completely different issue to inform your customer of that piece of information hours before closing, putting them into a position which is difficult to change without paying hundreds of dollars extra per year.

Bottom line: I won't bank with Newtown ever again on any services they offer and it's not that just I won't recommend that people do business will Newtown, I will go out of my way to inform everyone of my bad banking experience and implore them not to do business with Newtown.

"While the staff is friendly and able, the consumer services are strictly one star in terms of modern banking. Limited hours (not a single late night -- closes at 4 pm on the dot), no useful web presence (or phone access -- both buggy), NO WAY TO MAKE A DEPOSIT APART FROM A VISIT (remote deposits are only for commercial customers). This might not matter so much if Whalley Avenue address wasn't their ONLY location. Worse, any deposit larger than $500 triggers a 7 day hold before your check clears, regardless of whether the check is personal, a bank check or a money order.  Moreover, despite supposedly being a member of the Allpoint network, you cannot deposit a check via Allpoint and there are no plans to incorporate this ability as Allpoint rolls it out.  Last time I stopped in, I asked for labels or mailing envelopes so I could at least use snail mail but they didn't have any, nor do they have a link to download a label template so you can print them out yourself. The $500 seven day hold was a shocker for me, given I purposely deposited a TD Bank check so it would clear quickly. (This unusually low limit is something that should be clearly disclosed before you trouble to open an account). Had I mailed a 'naked' check, I'd have assumed it had been lost. Also -- the website and telephone banking system are pretty buggy, even just to check your balance.
But above and beyond all this, the biggest negative is the limits on electronic withdrawals, given the limited business hours. $350! And if you've gotten twenty or forty bucks cash back at the supermarket the same day, they deduct it from your limit. All banks have limits but few are this low in 2019 and I don't know of any that refuse to raise the limit by account holder request. So as hard as it is to get money into your account, it's even harder to get it out.  (there's no phone app and no plans to create one). You can't even transfer money from your checking account to a Walmart money card -- I asked.
Because the employees are so nice, I wish I could rate higher, but two stars is generous, given the limited utility of consumer accounts. (Note that those employees have no discretion when it comes to waiving account limitations, however personable they are).
Start Bank might still be  a good choice for locals who are trying to establish a banking history if their only other likely checking account option is the (otherwise more useful) Walmart Money Card.
Really, though, a seven day hold on a $500 check -- especially a bank check -- is absurd, as is a supposedly old fashioned bank that doesn't have a mechanism to deposit checks via snail mail.",03/23/2019 18:19:46,First Bank of Greenwich,maps,6,MIXED,0.0040274974890053,0.3291332423686981,0.0049009569920599,0.6619381904602051,POSITIVE,Social Internal,1,Social Internal

"Went to ion because its close to our storage warehouse to open a bank account . Met with one rep and then the manager came out and asked me to her office. She said without an ID no account could be opened, then implied that most ""black people"" do not have ID's and asked to see mine, then made a copy of it as if to say she wanted to verify it was real, as its not bank policy to make copies of Id's, after seeing the id she claimed the account would be opened, then cited that she would not open an account , after avoiding my calls the next day.

As soon as I entered the bank , I felt an aura of racism and bigotry. I felt that I should have left as soon as entered the doors. If you are black and visit the bank be prepared to be treated in the fashion racist ran establishments such as these behave towards people of color. The experience was horrible , it's sad to think we live in a day and age that a bank manager would imply that because a person is black they do not have proper paperwork and an ID to open a bank account, but that's what happened to me.

There was a time in American history when it was illegal for black people to have bank accounts because of their skin color, the bank manager at ion bank made me realize that those days are still active at her branch.

Racism is most certainly real, the bank manager is well aware of what she did and what her intentions were , she assumed that because I am black that I had no id or paperwork and literally said this. If she did it to me, she's been doing it to other people, if she did it to you ? speak up about it. The only way we can stop racists is by reporting them and their actions,. Being pacifist is not the way to go.",07/10/2022 16:49:09,Liberty Bank,maps,11,NEGATIVE,0.0051311878487467,0.7684196829795837,0.2148260772228241,0.011623035185039,POSITIVE,Governance,1,Governance

"Worst bank I ever had to deal with in my whole life. I had so many problems with them I could write a storybook. I don’t want to have to say something like this but I definitely felt racially discriminated against by one person in particular she had glasses and dark hair. And it was how she treated me every single time she was there for example one time I came to the drive thru area and I was ready to do a transaction so I pressed the call button I saw her go to the window, look at me she gave me a dirty look then went off do something else... 15 minutes went by sitting there with my car running someone pulls up in their car and is helped in one minute and they leave ..(they looked nothing like me) I pressed the call button again and she rudely says “you’ll be helped in a minute” another 10 minutes went by and finally she helped me and had an attitude towards me like she was disgusted she had to help me. I waited there probably almost half an hour with my car running. Every time I went to the bank she had an attitude towards me and was nice to people who looked different than me. Another time she helped me there was a problem in my bank account and she felt the need to tell me how I should be handling my money and to “watch it” first of all it’s none of her business to be making any comments on my personal affairs and trying to tell me how I should be doing things. The biggest problem I had with her and the bank was when my name changed so I did all the paperwork and sent a request for a new card. I asked if they do temporary cards she said “no we don’t do that here” and she told me I would receive a card in one or two weeks ... long story short I waited 8 months for a card that I never got and I kept asking numerous times why it was taking so long and I was always told “must be lost in the mail it’s not our problem” or “just wait another week or two” ...I finally closed my account because I couldn’t deal with it anymore and I was so stressed out every time I had to go to the bank because I knew I would run into more problems.

"This bank is all around just awful as a business. Brick & mortar banks aren’t really necessary anymore and Liberty ESPECIALLY isn’t interested in keeping customers. I’ve been a customer for almost 20 years and I’ve reached the final straw and am in the process of closing all accounts with them. For almost everything you have to go to the physical location which is a nuisance. I had a fraudulent charge from a gym (after I canceled my membership they kept charging me). I called Liberty, explained my situation and that I had physical proof of the gym’s error. Liberty rep told me they wouldn’t even investigate. They immediately sided with the business. Since they’re business is making money off of their customer’s life’s earnings, they should have those customer’s backs when their earnings are taken fraudulently, but that’s not the case with Liberty.

"Tried to order a replacement debit card because the numbers that aren't raised numbers but somehow printed on my card are almost wore off and you can't see them anymore. I was told they could order and mail me one in a week and I said yes. Then was told I'd have to go into a branch. Went into the branch and was told they could give me a new card but it would have a new different debit card #. Hard to imagine there's no way to reprint a card with the same debit card #. What? With just about every bill i have being on an automatic payment through my debit card # that would be a huge pita! Seriously? I bet a scammer can probably print a card out with my number on it and use it, but my bank can't? Wow. When I used the zelle service which they offer in their mobile app to transfer money it withdrew the money from my account twice and sent it to the recipient twice. Called the bank and they said there was nothing they could do I needed to call the recipient and have them send the money back to me. Wow again!

"Fairfield County Bank has been the epitome of what banking service should be for our company and for our family as well. We left a big bank because we were tired of talking to machines and finding a never ending turnover of personnel which made creating relationships virtually impossible.

We could not be happier banking here and we actually enjoy our trips to the bank. Fairfield County Bank has become a integral part of our business and family.

"2020 marked a significant milestone for me.  30 years in private practice!  It also marked 30 years as a Fairfield County Bank, or Ridgefield Bank( as I fondly still refer to it as) customer.   I have always subscribed to the notion of supporting the local merchant, it is an opportunity to support your community as well as build important , lasting relationships that you can count on, and the latter rung true this year.  It goes without saying that 2020 was a tough year for all of us.  For those in business there were many ups and downs, but all along the way the Georgetown Branch management was there to help me stay afloat.

"Tremendous experience. This branch truly has a personal touch and goes above & beyond for anybody (client or non client) that walks in through their doors. I came to this branch because I had a unique situation with my business & the PPP loan and I was seeking guidance, I was able to comfortably explain my situation to Ricky Arriaga over the phone, who then recommended that I get in touch with his manager, Anna Pace. After having a conference with Anna and Ricky, I felt confident that my issue would be taken care of. And I was not wrong, Anna and Ricky worked around the clock to make sure that I had the things I needed to resolve my situation in a timely manner. Mind you, I and my business were not even banking with First County at the time that I walked through their doors seeking help. Within the first five minutes of talking with Ricky and Anna, I wanted to move my business banking to their bank. My situation took less than a week to resolve, and I was not even a customer for the first couple of days, and that says a lot about their personal service and care for the people that walk into their branch. Fast forward to now, I am banking with them and constantly recommending my family and friends to go and open up an account at this branch. A personal touch, especially now a days seems like a lost touch, but this branch  has it and I can't say enough about it.

"Update: June 2022:
While we all had to deal with the virus, Fairfield County Bank did maintain banking options available to us. The lobby is available for in person visits. I have to say their branch manager, Janet West, is a pleasure to work with. She is in a perpetual state of joy and is efficient and will do what is required to retain clients banking needs.

While not the biggest on the banking block, this locally based bank offers some personalized service that can't be matched by the huge institutions that are managed by people you never see and underwriters that have no idea of what you do or who you are.

"Location and people in branch were fine. Bank itself has worst customer service and policies I've experienced in any bank large or small, in 35+ years of banking throughout the US (and that's saying something, there's a lot of terrible banks out there).  Pretty absurd, unreasonable and unapologetic.  Find another bank.

I'll give one example of the half dozen or so ridiculous experiences I've had in just a couple months as a customer (which they actually make fairly difficult to become - almost as if they're doing you some kind of favor).  Traveling for business earlier this week, tried to access the account and apparently entered the wrong password.  Get a message that the account is now locked.  Tried again, account is locked.  One wrong attempt - and I don't even think it was wrong.  So I try to reset password....which you can't do without entering your account number - which I don't write down and is on my desk at home.  EVERY other bank I've EVER dealt with will allow a password reset or account access either with basic info, or with other info (SSN, etc.) - and if not through the website/app, then at least through calling in.  Called them Monday.  Not this bank.  Get back from trip last night, go to the password reset page and enter all required info - get a message that the account is locked, won't even send password reset.  Today is Thanksgiving, so almost a week without being able to access account.  Just one of many ""inconveniences"" and hassles and annoyances with this bank.  Absolutely gorgeous branches, and I appreciate the lollipops as much as the kids probably do....but how about focusing on being a helpful, useful bank?!?",11/23/2023 15:43:50,Jewett City Savings Bank,maps,10,NEGATIVE,0.0040361904539167,0.9888851642608644,0.0038090283051133,0.0032696244306862,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

She introduced us to the most amazing relator and as a team the two were unstoppable! We just closed on our dream home that in this day and age we didn't think would be possible.

"WOW hands down the best experience I've had at a bank EVER. I do most of my banking with BoA but for several reasons I grew to resent my choice in banking partner. I walked in to this location in Shelton and was helped by Kristen and Katie. Katie listened very intently on what I was trying to accomplish for my banking needs and was SUPER helpful from the get go. Then Kristen took over and made things happen! I honestly felt like they were friends rather than just bank associates. I could tell they both genuinely cared and wanted to help me. You definitely don't find that at the BIG banks like BoA. I was so impressed with their service and customer service I decided to start the process and change banks. In the near future I will be finding out how they can help me with business banking needs bc I run my own insurance business. Last, Kristen needs to be in some sort of 'Olympics for banking' because I swear that girl could do everything with one hand tied behind her back and eyes blindfolded LOL Total pro both her and Katie.

"I reviewed Liberty previously but my review vanished mysteriously. Liberty as a business is unethical. I had a checking/savings with them for nearly two decades. After fulfilling my contractual obligation with the local Planet Fitness and cancelling, my cancellation wasn’t processed correctly and the gym continued to bill me for 3 months fraudulently. I cancelled PF in person and because they were swamped at the time, (hence the incorrect processing) they didn’t give me documentation. I called Liberty, explained the situation, and asked the charges to be refunded. The rep immediately sided with the business and told me they couldn’t help me and that they wouldn’t even investigate. So Liberty Bank is in business by making money off of your life’s earnings, but they don’t have your back to protect those earnings when companies steal them fraudulently. Something to consider. Integrity is important. Brick and mortar banks are dated anyway.

"My husband and I have been banking with Fairfield County Bank for too many years to count now, and in all those years I must say that this bank is the best banking institution hands down.  We each own businesses and have tried other banks in an effort to keep our personal banking separate from our professional banking but none of them ever came close to the service and dedication that this bank offers.  All of their associates are excellent but if I had to single out an individual who has been a shining star to us, Patricia Connelly, the Manager of the Fairfield Branch comes up first every time!  Recently my husband had his car broken into and they stole important banking information which caused us to have to close and reopen all of our accounts with our banks.  I had been using Fairfield County Bank for family, personal and business for years but my husband was using Chase for his business account at the time.  Chase was so unprofessional during this process causing him to visit the branch several times with a different story of what needed to be done each time.  One phone call to Patty and she had all of the paperwork done for us when we came in, all documents were ready to sign for closing the old account and opening the new ones and the transition seemed almost seamless.  My husband closed his business account with Chase and now we have all of our accounts with Fairfield County Bank.  Thank you Patty, and Fairfield County Bank, for always being there to answer questions and doing such an amazing job for us all these years!!  So glad to know, especially now during COVID, that you are only a phone call away!!",11/20/2020 17:39:18,Ion Bank,maps,9,POSITIVE,0.9039031267166138,0.0154714807868003,0.0530063174664974,0.0276190377771854,POSITIVE,Social External,1,Social External

"We have known Virginia E. Turnbull, SVP, Senior Commercial Lender, Fairfield County Bank, a long time and from our very first dealings with her in the banking business have always found her to be fair, honest, and trustworthy.
When we started buying commercial property we immediately went to Virginia for mortgaging.  She was efficient and thorough collecting all the information needed to process and secure mortgages for us.  When she joined Fairfield County Bank, we went to her for a new mortgage, replacing the mortgage we held on a commercial property in Woodbury, CT; a mortgage we are continuing to pay down today.
Through Virginia we met Patricia Connelly, the manager of the Trumbull Branch then, now the Tunxis Hill Branch and the professionalism we found in both of these executives made us very comfortable with the Bank.  We have moved to Florida and continue to bank long distance with the Tunxis Hill Branch.  They are efficient in processing our mail deposits and are courteous and knowledgeable when we call the Branch for information or assistance.
Because of our good and long relationship with the Bank, we have recommended using Fairfield County Bank to numerous friends and colleagues.

"I would not recommend Dime Bank to anyone due to their poor service and not caring about their customers.  I had an active checking and savings account for 3 months with weekly direct deposits of $1000+ every Friday.  Then one day the manager calls me and says that they had already closed my accounts and a check would be mailed to my home address.  Before I even had a chance to speak with the manager, Dime Bank had taken upon their decision to do this without my consent or notification prior to this action.  I immediately called them after listening to the manager's voicemail and said that I had a direct deposit coming in the next day and scheduled utility automatic bill payments.
The manager said that there was nothing that they could do since they already closed my accounts.  I requested that they have a check ready for me to pick up later than evening rather than waiting for an unspecified amount of time for it to arrive in the mail.  The manager agreed with my request but my work check was delayed by almost a week since Dime Bank blocked my direct deposit from closing my accounts.
I would never go back to Dime Bank as a customer ever again.  I actually went down the street to get new accounts with a better bank at Charter Oak Credit Union.  Charter Oak has must better customer service, products, and bank related fees.  Charter Oak also has more locations in the areas that I travel through which is definitely more convenient.

I went to this branch because the Rubber Ave branch in Naugatuck I usually go to and love was closed because of Covid and it is also walking distance from my workplace. When I entered two employees were talking and let me wait without even looking at me. Then one of the ladies came to me and told me she will be with me soon. I was waiting a couple of more minutes than I got seated. I had two questions on that day. The teller treated me like I was completely stupid. She was passive aggressive with all her responses and did not take the time to actually listen to what I was asking. By the time we finished our conversation I was swallowing my tears and left the bank without my issue  resolved. I will never go to that branch again. I hope the Rubber Ave branch will open up and I can go there where I was always treated well.,01/22/2022 18:41:37,Newtown Savings Bank,maps,13,MIXED,0.2505397498607635,0.3568220734596252,0.0307232644408941,0.3619149029254913,POSITIVE,Social Internal,1,Social Internal
Worst experience I ever had with a bank!!! Would rate zero stars if I could. I had so many problems dealing with the staff that I don’t even know where to start. I requested to have a new card because my current card was under the wrong name since my name changed they said it would take a week or two to come in. I NEVER received a card!! I had to keep using my card with the wrong info on it and I asked numerous times why it was taking so long and they said “must be lost in the mail” like are you serious?? And every time I needed to do a transaction at the bank they gave me attitude that the names didn’t match when it wasn’t even my fault that I didn’t have the correct name on there. Also there was a blonde girl who worked there I have no idea what her problem is but every time she saw me she gave me dirty looks and nothing but attitude. Also a number of times I had to give them “proof” that I was who I say I am because the cards didn’t match (ps. I went there weekly pretty sure they knew who I was)... since they declined to give me a new one and every single transaction they gave me problems because of that. After 8 months of waiting for a new card and countless times requesting one that never came and the staff being hard to deal with I finally closed my account and when I was closing it they mentioned “oh you could have gotten at temporary card”. ....are you serious???? Months of trouble and being stressed out from this and now you mention a temporary card??? Not once of the whole 8 months did they mentioned that to me. I’m so happy I no longer have an account there because it was stressful and difficult to do anything there and their staff has little to none customer service skills and I don’t think they even know how to do their job obviously.

"I have been a member of this bank since i opened my first account at 16y/o (5 years ago). Every single visit i have made to this bank has reinforced my reasoning for remaining a member.

I can't give less than 5 stars for the amazing service i received at this small/local bank. The only cons i would have are not related to this business specifically, but rather issues faced by small business banks. I work nights so sleeping during the day makes it hard for me to stop by during open hours (which are limited).

"After the financial crisis of 2008 I decided it would be wise to diversify my banking relationships.  DR Bank seemed like a good fit as an addition to my much larger major bank.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how friendly and welcoming everyone was—the manager, the tellers, everyone made me feel right at home.  Once we got my accounts up and running I was very pleased to see that DR offers the same advanced level of service as the “big bank” with which I was accustomed.  I travel constantly, having reliable online access to banking is important to me, and I have not been disappointed.  By the time of this review I have been a loyal customer for 14 years.  I still enjoy walking in and seeing the staff when I’m in town, who are always happy to greet me, help me, and find out where I’ve been and what I’ve been up to.

"After applying for a personal loan and seeing the interest rate I decided to move forward. I supplied all required documents, but was told there was an issue with my bank account being less than 12 months old and that they would not disperse funds to that account. Considering I've had this account for 10+ years I was confused, but still provided bank statements from more than two years ago.

For the next two weeks my bank account information was ""under review"". I called every 3-4 days for an update and was told ""underwriting is still reviewing but we will know in 24-48 hours"".

Finally after two weeks I called and said I have been waiting for too long and was told they'd have an answer today. My application was denied due to ""bank account not meeting lender requirements"". I then spoke with the manager and supplied her with a document from my bank showing the 10+ year age of the account, and was still denied.
They offered no explanation and only told me to hand write and mail a letter to dispute the claim with underwriting, which considering the past two weeks and attempts to resolve issue would be a waste of my time.

"I have been informing people with student loan debt for almost 5 years now, somewhat of an expert in the field.  In most of my guidance, it ends in pointing borrowers towards refinancing their student loans through Darien Rowayton Bank for their excellent customer service and incredible rates. DRB has a hidden gem in the fact that they can pay off your student loans, consolidate into a lower payment and interest rate, and allow you to choose your term without a fee.  It breaks my heart that more people don't know about this option and are blindly paying on their student loans without touching the principal balance.

"Here's the thing: the people at this bank are incredibly nice and do their best to be helpful, but I'm at the end of my rope when it comes to other things that make this a deal breaker.

I've been trying to purchase a computer and have been unable to do so even though I have over $2000 more dollars in the account than is needed to purchase it. The problem is that there's apparently a daily limit you're allowed to spend. Excuse me? It's my money, first of all. I get that fraud protection is important, but I'm talking to them personally telling them it's alright and giving them all my personal information so they've verified it's me, but no one at the bank actually has the ability to allow me to spend my own money. So they have to call an administrator that takes an entire day to get back to them. And then they take at least half a day to get back to me.

So we figure that out. Finally my daily limit has been increased so I can buy this one item. It still doesn't go through. I call them again. Now they're telling me that because the bank the computer store uses is in another state, that's a problem apparently. So I can't buy it until they call the administrator again, tomorrow. And then it'll be the weekend. So at the earliest, I might be able to order the computer next week. Are you kidding me? I'm furious. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, but this is not fair to me, this is not a good way to run a business, and I don't know how other banks conduct this process, but this is unacceptable for any bank and if I can find another bank to use so that I don't have to go through this again I'm going to switch banks.

This isn't about them protecting me. This is about them protecting themselves and holding onto their money. While the tellers are awesome, the institution itself clearly doesn't care about its patrons. I doubt any bank does, but these practices are totally out of line and I'm done.",06/26/2020 19:12:00,Jewett City Savings Bank,maps,10,NEGATIVE,0.0174997616559267,0.7738802433013916,0.0231787636876106,0.1854412108659744,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Social External

"I have banked with Essex savings in old lyme for a long time. They have been progressively more difficult more recently. Exponentially difficult!

I was told to get a calendar by Betsy. Told to remove auto payment from bill pay to prevent overdrafts occurring- when money was just in the wrong account.  Pay my bills manually following a calendar.

Sure that’s viable. But when I am asking what the bank can do to assist me and the first idea they have is adding tasks to my single man business operations. The solution is to find a new bank.  Get out while the getting is good. I’m going to Citizens.

"Terrible bank to have when you’re in need of emergency assistance.

I’ve been out of the Connecticut and needed assistance to speak to someone regarding my accounts and their would be no one to answer my questions which is very frustrating. I understand that yes the bank may be closed and everyone may be gone but a bank should definitely have a number to contact (1-800) in case of emergency assistance instead of giving me and option to leave a voicemail.

"The people at Bankwell, in every interaction I've had at the branch and over the phone are lovely and professional.  Unfortunately, due to maddening issues with both mobile and desktops apps (inexplicably unable to log in multiple times and hours long on phone with tech help and multiple password resets just to get in), a total lack of functionality of the ATM (inability to show recent transactions, only your balance), and today, inability to stop payment on a lost check in which I knew the check # and the approximate amount, but not down to the penny, as I forgot to write it down.  So I'm screwed if someone did pick up this check and cashes it.  Disclaimer, I don't know if this would be the case at any other bank, but it was the last straw for me, and I will be closing my account.

As a bookkeeper I’m in contact with many different banks throughout the year. I’ve never had so much trouble in my entire career with a bank before. I would never recommend this bank to any person going into business. I’ve talked to customer care six times to resolve this issue and things are still not resolved at this time. Im appalled that first when I ask for business banking I don’t get transferred directly to them and then find myself in a position where the agent is unable to help me because they are not in business banking. And second The fact that my client has added me to both of his business accounts yet they still need approval to link my online banking to the account. It’s very frustrating.

"When I first started with this bank I was really impressed. The costumer service is great. Peggy and Rachel from the Oxford branch are amazing and kind. HOWEVER, the overdraft forgiveness policy is abismal. My account over-drafted by three times in two days by accident and I was told they can only forgive one of the three and after that they will be no more overdraft forgiveness. On the other hand I know a handful of banks that forgive those if you have a very good reason because these banks understand that sometimes life happens. Can’t say the same about newtown savings bank. I closed my accounts and found a bank that can waive overdrafts and on top of that gives me free ATM anywhere and the fee for overdraft is $29 instead of the $37 I got charged at Newtown. Not that an overdraft will happen again...hopefully. Oh and I almost forgot. The Oxford ATM has a tendency of eating your cash deposits and withdrawals.

"This branch of Union Savings bank is by far the worst one I have been to. The Torringford st branch is exemplary with their service as well as the canton one, however this branch on main st in Torrington has never given me or my mother great service. They are slow, they make you feel as if you are a burden to them, and they are not very customer friendly. I waited in the drive through for 5-8 minutes to be addressed, then another 10 to get my receipt back for depositing a check overall it was 15-20 minute wait. Another time I went the woman just said hello grabbed my deposit slip then went and helped another customer in the middle of my transaction. My mother has also stated that his main st branch is always rude to her as well. Maybe the management there is bringing down their employees or maybe they all just really dont want to be there, but they could learn a thing or two from the wonderful folks at the Torringford branch.

"I honestly dont understand what happened to this bank. The customer service has gone down hill since it switched over to Ion. Iv been with this bank for so long and Iv gotten so fed up with it that im finally switching banks. First of all I went away on vacation and forgot to call them to let them know I was gonna be out of state. They locked me out of my account by locking my debet card. I called them and told me them that it was me using and the card and they said ok we will unlock it. Well they didnt and I had to call them 4 more times to get the card unlocked. Turns out they never did and I had to go to the main bank when I got back and get it taken care of. Iv had other problems with since then, pretty much everytime I call. The most recent thing to happen I had to report my card lost. I called them and asked them to send me another card. They said they were going to and that they put the order in.

"I have been a customer of SBD for the last 23 years. I was very disappointed to see that they do not have the personalized service they once had, which led me to get a couple fees for a transaction that took place in my account. In the past, I would have gotten a call to alert me to a problem that was arising and it would never have gone this far. When I reached out and spoke to the assistant VP, he was very friendly and responsive, but he was not able to fully rectify the situation of reversing both fees when he spoke with a higher up a the bank (he did reverse one fee). It seems like it didn't make any difference that my husband and I have been loyal customers for so many years. It was a real disappointment that the bank did not honor this long standing relationship and take into account the changes that have taken place since the bank has grown in size (i.e., no more  reaching out to let a customer know a problem is arising, which I wasn't aware of until this problem arose).",02/14/2022 18:57:54,Chelsea Gronto Bank,maps,2,NEGATIVE,0.0116743147373199,0.6472785472869873,0.0029187430627644,0.338128387928009,POSITIVE,Social External,1,Social External
"With the exception of the first criticism below, this review is strictly intended for the “new” New Milford branch of Savings Bank of Danbury (“SBD”) and NOT the Kent Road branch near the Big Y.

It seems that while other banks started to relax their rules and allow customers to enter their branches as society began to adjust to COVID—19, SBD - as recently as July (the month of my most recent visit) - maintained a minimal at best access protocol.  The problem, at least from my experience, is that this was not reflected on the main entrance of the branch.  Other banks, such as Webster, displayed signs indicating, “By appointment only.”  People’s United Bank - with social distancing protocols in place - was allowing walk-ins in July.

And now for the “new” New Milford branch (“the ‘new’ NM branch or “the branch”).

I sometimes feel, having watched and listened over the years, that I know more than the person sitting across the desk or standing on the other side of the counter.

I went into the new NM branch on July 13, 2020 to make a deposit to two different accounts.  (Just to note, while I take COVID-19 seriously, I have not encountered any other banks and / or businesses where “once you touch a pen it’s yours.  I walked out with at least two SBD pens that day.)

I was taken inside “as a courtesy” by a gentleman who, I believe, said his name was Jay.  (Note:  Initially, it seemed as though my business was destined to be conducted in the parking lot but I DIDST protest because it was, quite simply, much too hot outside.). Once inside, I dealt with Jay and a young man by the name of Mustafa.  I am not overbearing or a micromanager by any means, but I conveyed from the get go what I was looking to do and watched as my transactions were processed.

To make along story short, this is what transpired upon my exiting the branch but prior to driving off:

I found an error, called the branch, and was told that Jay would come to me.  (We were going to conduct at least some business in that parking lot come **** or high water!).  Upon coming out, Jay said the mistake had already been fixed in the computer but had me “sign the updated sheet anyway.“. And, once again, I got to keep the pen.

At home, I found what I thought to be another error and decided to notify the branch via email.  I called the SBD main number and was told that the branch email was newmilforddanburyrd@sbdanbury.com.  I then sent an email, addressed to Jay and Mustafa, clearly outlining the error.  To this day, I have never heard back from either of them.

I received two pieces of correspondence from SBD revealing that my requests were not correctly fulfilled back in July.

Personally, I am starting to lose faith in SBD (especially since there are so many other banks to choose from with a wider array of account types to choose from).  And I would be more understanding if they were busy that day, but I was the only patron in the branch.

"I switched here from Webster in North Haven and, let me tell you, the difference is like night and day. Much better customer service. Webster could not care less about my issues despite the money moving through their accounts. Liberty has really proven reliable and responsive. My account reimburses others’ ATM fees and I have had no issues with them since moving to the area. Which on that note: they also have locations in my area while Webster is more SW CT and not much else...

My only “complaint” is the speed of their ATM service at this location. I don’t know if it’s the computer system or the particular machine or what but it’s really slow and needs some calibration because “no...I do not want another transaction.”",12/26/2018 21:26:36,M&T Bank,maps,20,MIXED,0.454763263463974,0.0401549562811851,0.0092068472877144,0.4958749711513519,POSITIVE,Social External,1,Social External

So I went to Union Savings. i LOVE them, the branch Manager knows who i am and remebers me. they also gave me a call to let me know that if you don't pay an over-drafted account i will get charged, unlike Chase who 1) NEVER told me they did the same thing & 2) when I did put money in my account to pay down what i owed them, the next day I  owed them more then B4 I put money in there. The people @ Union Savings are all SUPPER nice & I don't plan on taking my business to another bank till after I move out of CT and i will be sad to leave.

Local branches are amazing with great people.

"We've had nothing but great experiences with Fairfield County Bank in general, but since moving to the Danbury area and making this branch ""our branch"" we've been consistently impressed with their attentiveness and willingness to help with any issue, big or small. From taking up their time to discuss hypothetical loan options on a Saturday with two kids in tow, to small issues within our various accounts that they were quick to fix for us, they are always so patient and eager to help. Most recently, they caught (before we did) an issue with fraud in one of our accounts and worked hard to protect us and keep us safe going forward.

"We rececently got a mortage for our first home through NSB, and our experience was phenomenal all around. Competitive rates, great customer service, transparency, and rapid processing.

Our Loan Officer was Natalie Espinal, and we cannot praise her highly enough. With such tight timelines for our purchase, Natlie truly went above and beyond to help us. In fact, there's a very good chance we would've not gotten the house had it not been for some of the rapid turnaronds Nataline managed!

READ THIS!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I wouldn’t give this bank one star. They hit me with $100 of overdraft fees from $90 worth of payments!!! Even with Covid and being sick all of last month there was no way they could overturn the overdraft fees for me. I told them I’m very busy and don’t have time to waste on things like this. They simply kept offering other services to me but I just want my money back!!! On top of this their ATM’s are as old as dirt and probably run off coal!!! I just ordered a card from Varo which doesn’t make you pay overdraft fees and I’m about to close my account here. I was planning on applying for a loan and opening a savings account with them today but they couldn’t help me with this one thing. That goes to show you their level of customer service! I would suggest to try anything else before opening an account here!,12/08/2021 18:34:04,Chelsea Gronto Bank,maps,2,NEGATIVE,0.000520909030456,0.999393105506897,6.169518746901304e-05,2.4318484065588564e-05,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

"The best bank and employees that work there.
I have been with this bank for 18 years.
I’m not a number, I am a person, greeted by name whether I call or visit.
I moved out of CT 13 years ago and decided against changing to a different bank.
I’m content with the services and reviews at FCB.
Read some reviews of the big banks and you’ll understand why I’m still there.
When you have staffing that stays on their jobs for a longtime, it’s obvious that FCB values their employees too.

"I have been locked out for 2+ weeks.  I spoke with Amy Williams and, besides being very courteous as many are, she was able to help me get back on line.  Although I hope I don't have to go through this hassle again, if I do, I will call Amy to help me through the problems again.  She is highly professional and I thank her again.

On a separate note, it is ridiculous to have a recovery process that takes 2+ weeks and is out of the staff's hands.  That is not in the least customer friendly.  The lockout was my problem through inadvertently responding incorrectly to the login questions.  That happens.  A recovery should be able to be effected immediately upon a phone call and verification.  On another note, your vendor, since I was told the problem was created by the mysterious vendor, is that you cannot automatically make international calls.  I am frequently in France and cannot receive phone calls except by human intervention, e.g. for wire transfers.

"I have been going to the bank on Rte1 in Stonington for 20 years cashing my paycheck, today I go there and you cant talk to real people. I had to talk to someone who speaks so low you can't even hear them.

I don't feel comfortable dealing with someone you can't hear.
Is Chelsea Groton Bank really eliminating talking to tellers face to face? If so don't put a machine next to a busy road so the cars driving by are louder than the rep with an attitude. When I called the main number to ask where there is an actual bank with people the little girl Kaylee (voice sounded like a little girl trying to act cutesy) said water street in mystic.

"I've been banking with Chelsea Groton for over 10 years now and today I had the worst customer experience ever. I have had mr overdraft protection since I opened my checking account. There have been times where I needed it since I live on my own, pay Bill's, eat, put oil in the tank to stay warm, gas in my car so I can get to my job, and I was upset and shocked with what just happened. I never recieved a letter from them, even though I was told that they did send a letter that my overdraft privileges were going to be taken away.  I've been with this bank for over 10 years and my family has been banking with them for over 20 years. 
I called them today because I couldn't use my card for medicine. When I called them I was told that the person in charge would have to call me back because they were on the phone. When they called me back I was told that my account was in the negative for 30 days which is impossible because I get paid every two weeks. I was also told that I went over my overdraft last week in which I put in a stop payment which never happened. My account has been in the positive for the last two weeks. I was then told that I can put a request in to get my overdraft privileges back but that is no guarantee, its reviewed. I was disappointed that after 10 years or so of being a checking account holder I was treated like this.

"Once upon a time, there was plenty of money to go around.  Banks were giving loans left and right, along with toasters in many cases, and it seems that the only requirement to get a huge mortgage was that you have a pulse.  Even that was waived in some cases.

Unless, you actually had a job and needed to finish building a house.  In that case, no-one would consider lending you the money.  Ours was not a big extravagant house, it was modest, but we needed some more things, like drywall, plumbing fixtures, etc.

After calling just about every bank we could think off, we finally hit upon the bright idea of calling our local bank, and who would have thought?  They gave us the loan, along with decent customer service, convenient hours and several branches.

The loan is now paid and the house is still there.

The free money party, however, is now over.

The only thing I can say about this bank was that it is a very convenient bank if you are shopping in the area or visiting and you want to get some quick cash. They have a 24 hour ATM which is extremely convenient. There's also handicapped parking right in front of the bank as well as regular parking on the street for a limited time. I believe it said 15 minute parking so that you could use the bank. I love the decorations in the front and because it was Veterans Day the streets were decorated with lots of flags.

very poor service and lack of communication. This bank also seems to be stuck in the 1990s. Forcing people to come in person (which for someone with 2 babies is not the easiest) when other banks are changing to cater their clients needs Ion continues to drop the ball. In person is a long and slow experience with people unable to properly do their job which speaks volumes on a complete lack of training.

Then they go and print something that they read to me, make me sign, and then send me on my way. The last time, a new teller had to check with a senior teller who scrutinized the check and loudly announced ""What is this? Alimony?"" Very loudly.

"I have been banking with Liberty Bank for years. Why? because while every other bank changes names Liberty Bank remains the same. Service with a smile and the small town friendly folks there make banking a pleasure.

They have added more branches to serve us better, but I enjoy the ease of their on-line baking. Bill reminders and easy set-up make this work for us.

"Been a Liberty Bank customer for decades. Also a TD Bank customer. Decided to move some money from TD Bank to Liberty Bank, so I had TD Bank wire over a significant deposit to Liberty. Liberty had the nerve to charge a $10 fee for the incoming deposit. Went to the branch I've used for decades. They said they can't reverse fees, but to call the Liberty line. The first Liberty line representative said she'd get back to me on reversing the fee within a couple of days. Weeks later, she never called back. The representative I spoke with today said that fees are in the updated disclosure documents and he will not reverse it. If Liberty Bank is so eager to charge fees that they are now charging for deposits, I will certainly take my deposits and my banking to TD Bank. Liberty Bank is not what it was years ago.

"I've been with this bank for 10 years with no issues other than the occasional overdraft fee due to some charge I may have forgotten about at the time. However, two weeks ago I tried to deposit a check I received from my aunt and three days later my mobile and online banking accounts were locked. I called in and was told they were going to look into it and get back to me in 3 business days. During this time my aunt had taken out the money and given me the money in cash to deposit. I never tried to resubmit the check after that but still couldn't access my account. A week passed with no return call and I received a letter saying they couldn't accept the check and were deducting a $15 fee. I call back and am told to wait again. I receive a call 20 minutes later telling me my account is pending closing because it looks like I tried to deposit a fake check so I can either go to a local branch or wait to receive the official paperwork. I packed up my newborn and went down to the bank where the lady working at the time was very helpful and assisted me in pleading my case, however, despite her trying to fight it for 20 minutes, she informed me that the call had already been made to close my account and that all she could do was destroy my debit card and withdraw all my money. 10 years, since I was 16 with no incidents and this is what I get in return. The craziest part is that my mother also received a check from the same aunt and deposited it the same day only for it to bounce and her to have to deposit the cash she gave her yet no action has been taken against her account.

"Absolutely the worst!  We tried to give the local bank a chance.  Forget it!  Unless you are doing deposits or withdrawals, this bank is incapable of handling any other sort of transaction in a timely matter.  Drove to the Boston Post Road location on July 2nd.

There was one man in the seat who tried to come in at noon, but was unable to get service because that ONE person who could help him was at lunch.  Poor Bastard!  So he was waiting in one chair which left the other chair open for the both of us.  We waited from 2:00-2:45.  Nobody said, ""thank you for waiting"" or ""sorry we are understaffed.""  One woman was counting money,  another woman was working the counters.  The person working the desk was with a customer, a fourth woman punched out and said goodbye to everyone as customers sat there.  Although no acceptable acknowledgment of their neglect was issued, I did hear the woman counting the money ask why people were waiting, although I couldn't hear the whole response, I did hear ""we can only do, what we can do?""

"I really hate this bank.  It's almost like they bend over backwards to charge an overdraft fee.  The latest indignity was when I had my ""available balance"" go into the negative after and BECAUSE I made a deposit, apparently because I transferred some of the money into savings.  The teller informed me I was not in danger of an overdraft, but when a $3 check was presented that day, they cashed it and charged me $29.  The next day another small check was cashed, another $29.  The online banking system is about 24 hours behind ""real time"" transactions, so even though I check the stupid thing three times a day and think I have money, I get surprised the next day when it's too late to do anything about it.  It probably doesn't help that my previous bank, in another state, was very customer-oriented;  they did whatever they could to make sure incidents like this didn't happen.  I hate this bank.

"Despite what *could* be the most convenient bank I ever had, over the last six years I've shared a neighborhood with this bank, we've had a bit of a rocky start.

The first two times I visited the bank, I needed something notarized. I was told to take a seat and I would be helped. Despite no additional customers entering the bank between the time I entered and the entire time I waited, I was left sitting for over 20 minutes. Feeling abandoned and forgotten both times, I went to the UPS store across the street. I now don't bother considering Thomaston Savings Bank for my notary needs. Most recently, I came in, wearing my work uniform, with one dollar and asked for 2 rolls of pennies. Nothing crazy, just 2 rolls. Why did I ask for these rolls? Because the manager at my workplace was on vacation and left us without pennies by mistake. Since Thomaston Savings Bank is very close to my workplace, and because it's even closer to home, I figured I'd stop by on my way to work. I didn't even get to explain the importance of my work emergency (and how my work's bank is the next town over and how I have no vehicle or way to get there), because I was sternly informed that was a service for their customers only. It was disheartening, considering how they *seem* like a community bank, and how a request for 2 rolls of pennies in an extenuating circumstance is an extremely low risk transaction, with an opportunity to gain both a new customer, and let the person know that Thomaston Savings Bank is a helpful member of the community. 

These three experiences caused me to no longer consider starting a relationship with this bank, despite how temptingly close it is to my home, despite how fancy the atm machine is, nor how bright and welcoming the facility seems. It's kinda a shame, but I don't like feeling ignored and turned away by my community bank.

In the end, another bank in the area happily exchanged my dollar for 2 rolls of pennies.

"The Torrington Savings Bank office in Goshen is a nice location; they have a fair amount of parking, picnic table in the back, and a drive up ATM and teller.

I tried to get in to see my account it was two in the morning I needed to transfer funds this happens a lot unfortunately their second safety measure doesn't work if it sends you a code you don't know it because you can't see it or hear it come through if you want it to ring your phone it doesn't and there's no way to get it to do that after three tries it will block you out for the entire weekend and it has no 24 hour service where a human being can fix it for you you're just out of luck so if you're out of the country or out of the state and you don't even know what your balances it's like not having an account at all,09/18/2023 10:04:08,Torrington Savings Bank,yelp,18,NEGATIVE,0.0019694084767252,0.9866915941238404,0.0019875522702932,0.0093514742329716,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Social External
"When my mother's bank left the Torrington area I wanted her to use a more 'national' brand since we lived in different states and it would be easier for me to help her if she used a national brand.

"Other lenders tend to recommend TSB if you have any kind if minor credit issues and you need a loan, they say because a local bank usually has more leverage.  I get it is not TSB's fault that other lenders say this but TSB dose claim to have excellent customer service , excessive knowledge of loans,  and can offer real hometown banking.  This may be true if you earn 50-100 thousand dollars are year and bank with them, or you have stellar credit.  If you do not fall into any of these categories forget it , not only will you be denied without any opportunity to speak with someone ( if you apply online ) , you also will not hear ANYTHING from anyone in regards to your loan status. You can call , email and you will just get the run around, and in the end just get a letter in the mail saying your denied.  The letter they sent me said my credit was just barley 500, but I have reports directly from all 3 credit bureau's and they all matched at 660.  I tried to get a opportunity to show them this and question why they where 160 points less but was never given the opportunity , they just didn't want to hear it.    I went with another local lender and was very pleased with there professionalism , courtesy and communication even though they could not help me now, they are helping me get where I need to be so they can offer me a excellent loan and rate in another 6 months.

"Never thought I would review a bank but I saw them listed here and decided it was appropriate.  I have done business with them for years.  They have been around for like 100 years and will be around for a lot longer.  A true hometown bank.  They're from the area and they understand it.  They hold onto all of the mortgages they write, and I'll bet they have written very, very few bad loans over the years.  Makes me feel even more angry about taxpayer bailouts of so many other greedy know-nothing banks who were out to give no income verification loans to any idiot they could sell one to, because the banks never intended to hold onto the loans in the first place, but rather sell them to be camouflaged into derivatives to be sold to other, unsuspecting fools.

But today, at the Brookfield Branch by Costco--experienced the nastiest, most unfriendly tellers ever! I'm a bookkeeper so I bank quite frequently and for multi-million dollar companies. No one was in the bank, so I wanted 2 different tellers to process my deposits from a non-profit so I could get in & out quicker. One had the nerve to say ""Well if a customer comes in, I'll have to stop yours (deposit)""
Ok--and what am I??? Not a customer? Lucky for me there are many other branches, because I won't be back there again! Two words--Mean Girls!

"I really don't like that I couldn't send flowers and a gift basket to Canada for my aunt's funeral on time, without them blocking the card.  Did you know you cannot use the Union Savings Debit Card for any transactions overseas including Canada? It's actually better and cheaper and safer to stop banking there altogether and get a PayPal account which has less fees and is more progressive. They eventually unblocked the card for me for 24 hours. So wait, I can use my own money? That's just unreal. Dear Union Savings Bank Corporate, If you're having problems with fraud overseas you need to build a robust security system, not limit the usage of your customers money. And more importantly, not ask customers to come in a branch and sign a release. That makes no sense. What if The customer was actually in Canada? Customers should be notified via  email that their transaction didn't go through, then be linked to their online account where they can go through a list of security questions and be allowed to charge what they want, wherever they want. Limiting the use of ones money is bad banking. I feel bad for the nice people working at the bank locally in Litchfield that have to enforce these bogus policies. Give them a break too.

"True, your money may be safe there, but only when you can actually access it. After having lived in a large city and then moving to NWCT I was looking forward to slowing down a bit and enjoying a more relaxed, personal environment. But Union Savings is waaaay too laid back.
Yes, they are nice at the branches, for the most part. I was denied notary services from the branch manager because she ""didn't feel comfortable"" signing the form as she ""hadn't seen one of these particular forms before."" So? It was a legal form. 
My biggest problem was that if I deposited any kind of check on a Friday, it wasn't available until the following Tuesday. If that Monday happened to be a holiday, funds were available the following Wednesday. Today I attempted to log in to my online banking account and I miss-typed my password three times. My account access was blocked and I was prompted to call customer service. Ok, that's cool, you are simply protecting me from fraud. But when I went to call customer service I was told, via a recording, that they do not hold Sunday hours. What would I do if my debit card was stolen? Wait until after the weekend to call?

"As banks test the many possible use cases for generative AI – deep-learning models that can analyze large volumes of data and generate statistically
probable outputs when prompted – one area of interest is small business lending. A generative-AI-based virtual assistant or copilot can help shepherd small business owners through the time-consuming and sometimes perplexing loan application process and take care of much of the work loan officers typically do, such as data validation, qualification and loan approval.
  One bank trying this out is Bankwell Bank in New Canaan, Connecticut.
   In the six months Ryan Hildebrand has been chief innovation officer at the community bank, he has been looking for ways to make it more efficient and innovative. In one example, he met the team of a startup called Cascading AI through an investor and thought the generative AI technology they had built could be applied to make small business lending more efficient.
  ""I am a huge, huge believer in small business and banking,"" Hildebrand said in an interview. ""But it's always been done in a way that just doesn't make sense for a bank.""
   Lending to small businesses is labor intensive, which is why some banks don't do it. Small business loans are sometimes more complicated and usually less profitable than loans made to large commercial clients.
   ""Small businesses are less organized than larger ones, so leading them through the application process just takes a lot of time, a lot of handholding, writing emails back and forth to remind someone that you still need that 2021 tax return,"" said Lukas Haffer, CEO and founder of Cascading AI, in an interview.
  Banks have been testing generative AI cautiously, well aware of the dangers of hallucination, wrong answers and plagiarism. In a not-yet-released American Banker survey of 127 bank executives, 61% of community bankers said they are still learning and collecting information about generative AI. Among all respondents, 80% were concerned that generative AI could create nonsensical or inaccurate information.
  Bankwell Bank began piloting Cascading AI's Casca software to prequalify and make loans to potential small business borrowers.
  ""We've just seen tremendous success with it, even in the first months of this, versus the prior four months,"" Hildebrand said. He declined to share specific numbers but said Casca helps bring leads that were ""five or six times the quality"" of what was coming in through organic marketing.
  The bank recently launched a new Small Business Administration 7(a) lending program to issue more small loans to small businesses that were being offered high interest rates from online lenders. The SBA guarantees a portion of these loans, which enables the bank to offer a lower interest rate because it's not bearing all of the risk in case the loan defaults.
  But the process of applying for these loans can be confusing and lengthy, Haffer said. ""And when you don't have everything together, it takes a lot of work for the bankers,"" he said.
  Small business owners are always busy, and can rarely find time to talk to their banker. They sometimes have employees in the room with them, so they don't necessarily want to talk about their financial situation and why they want a loan, Hildebrand noted.
  Small businesses can have random questions, too, such as, what is an EIN? (It's an employer identification number, akin to a business taxpayer identification number.)
  In the pilot of Casca, a potential small business borrower comes to Bankwell Bank's website and fills out a form, providing basic information to see if they prequalify for a loan. Several tasks need to happen to determine if the business is truly qualified for a loan and eligible for the SBA program.
  Cascading AI's virtual assistant, which is named Sarah, works through those tasks, asking the customer follow-up questions like, ""How many years has the company been in business?"" and ""Tell me why you need a loan.""
  A human lender would have to call the customer and flesh it out more. Casca can do this work at any time.
  ""We're able to do it through AI at 11:30 on a Friday night, which – go figure – is really the time that we see the most uptick,"" while loan officers are off duty, Hildebrand said.
  The generative AI model analyzes the applications to determine which loans can be approved, but a human reviews each case.
  ""There's always a human in the loop,"" Hildebrand said. ""We're not completely doing away with that. From a risk standpoint, there's all sorts of issues that obviously get brought up. But, there's always someone there reviewing all the conversations.""
  This helps alleviate the risk of hallucination , when the AI makes things up.
  ""At scale, I think that is the issue,"" Hildebrand said. ""I just don't see us not having every single thing reviewed by a human.""
  Having the AI start the conversation is a big help, he said.
  ""The lender, in the past, would call them on Monday morning and still not get an answer,"" Hildebrand said. ""Weeks would go by just to figure out if the borrower was going to be eligible or not. So the first part on the prequalification side is huge for us.""
  Sarah has been trained on SBA policies and the bank's lending policies.
  ""We're not fully ready to say, okay, Sarah, you're the true SBA lending expert at this point,"" Hildebrand said. ""But I think the idea at some point is really being able to think through how to have a copilot for these things. I think that's a huge opportunity to save time.""
  When customers get confused or realize they don't have some information they need, they tend to close out of an online loan application, Haffer said.
  At Bankwell, ""within a couple of minutes, they get a message from the infinitely friendly, infinitely kind, infinitely respectful Sarah, that has infinite time for them and says, Hey, I saw that you started an application for a $75,000 working capital loan on our website. I'd love to learn a little bit more about your company. Can you tell me what you're looking for funding for? And here's a link to go back into the application."" Sarah will note where the potential borrower left off and offer to help with that field.
  ""The first time we sent the first message, about five weeks ago, everything changed,"" Haffer said. ""The first person immediately responded to the message, said, Hey, I got confused. I didn't know what an EIN was. Sarah responded back, well, it is often called taxpayer identification number. You can find it in this letter."" The borrower went back into the application and submitted the correct data and documents.
  Sarah keeps borrowers informed about the status of their loan application and lets them know of any additional information or documents they need to provide.
  ""So this person who otherwise would've been lost and no one would've had the time to follow back up with them, now is getting this infinite amount of time and care and attention,"" Haffer said. ""The secret behind all of it is people actually do like talking to someone and people actually respond to an email from Sarah.""
  Sarah identifies herself as an AI assistant. ""But people don't care,"" Haffer said. ""People just have someone reaching out, giving them the information they need, giving them the link to jump back into the application. And they do.""
  Haffer estimates Cascading AI automates about 90% of the loan process. Where a loan officer might normally spend a lot of the day chasing after applicants to upload the right documents, now they can just review the work and approve loans. The San Francisco startup raised $3.9 million this week, in a pre-seed funding round led by Peterson Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, The Sarah Smith Fund, and Clocktower Technology Ventures.
  Behind the scenes, several large language models were used to create Casca. Haffer declined to share details about this.
  ""All of it has gone through the bank's compliance and security procedures to make sure that we're not sharing sensitive data with anyone that isn't supposed to be privy to that information,"" he said.
  To provide explainability (and prove that Casca is not the kind of black box regulators have been warning about), the company provides a full audit log in the loan origination system.
  ""We have access to all the actions that an applicant took – when did they submit the application, when did they agree to the terms and conditions, et cetera,"" Haffer said. ""We have access to all the information about what loan officers and users of the system did, like which loan officer approved this loan, put it into a next stage, decided to collect these additional documents."" There is a record of every prompt the model received and its responses.
  Bankwell is Cascading AI's first client; Haffer said he is in talks with a few other banks.
  ""Our mission for the last four months was to build a system that actually brings AI into reality, is useful and fully compliant for one client and solves problems for them,"" Haffer said. Now the company is focused on scaling up the Bankwell installation and onboarding two more banks.

The Mountain Hawks dropped both games to Navy while picking up two wins over the Bison, riding excellent play from the bullpen to two close victories. Lehigh currently sits in fourth place in the league, which would qualify them for the postseason.
 Rider (12-14) had a slow start to the season, dropping their first six games on route to a 2-14 record. However, the Broncs are now riding a ten-game win streak, which has included MAAC conference sweeps of Quinnipiac, Saint Peter's and Siena. Rider advanced to the second round of the Liberty Bell Classic by defeating Villanova 9-7 at home on March 26. The Broncs are looking to defend their Liberty Bell Classic crown, as Rider defeated Delaware 8-3 in last year's final.
 The winner of Tuesday's game will face the winner of Lafayette and Delaware in the Liberty Bell Classic Final at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia on Wednesday, April 10 at 4 p.m. Like Lehigh Baseball on Facebook, follow on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram for exclusive content, team updates and more.",2024-04-08T21:46:35Z,Citizens Bank,news,21,NEUTRAL,0.051615260541439,0.0011147478362545,0.947262406349182,7.545390417362796e-06,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports
  The Atlanta Braves placed Spencer Strider on the 15-day injured list on Sunday, one day after announcing the star right-hander has an ulnar collateral ligament sprain in his pitching elbow. In a corresponding move, the Braves recalled right-hander Allan Winans from Triple-A Gwinnett. Winans, 28, could be a long-relief option in the coming days or start in Strider's spot in the rotation Wednesday against the New York Mets. He was 1-2 with a 5.29 ERA, eight walks and 34 strikeouts in 32 1/3 innings over six games (all starts) last season with Atlanta. Strider, 25, left his Friday start against the Arizona Diamondbacks after four innings due to elbow discomfort. Strider will be evaluated by Dr. Keith Meister in Arlington, Texas, at a date yet to be determined, the team said Saturday. Strider, who finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting last season, led the majors with 20 wins and 281 strikeouts in 186 2/3 innings. In his first two starts this year, however, he has gone just nine total innings, and his velocity has been down a few miles per hour. He struck out four and walked three on Friday in the Braves' 6-5, 10-inning win. In his two starts, Strider has an ERA of 7.00, more than double his career mark of 3.47. Strider underwent Tommy John elbow surgery in 2019 while at Clemson, and a second such procedure would likely sideline him for at least a year. --Field Level Media

"Edges of the Los Angeles Dodgers roster have undergone some turnover over the past week, which included Dinelson Lamet getting designated for
assignment as part of the team acquiring Connor Brogdon in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies.
  The Dodgers traded Minor League pitcher Benony Robles to the Phillies for Brogdon, who was DFA'd last week.
  Prior to the deal, the Dodgers had called up Nabil Crismatt and more recently Gus Varland to have a fresh pitcher available to help what's been a slightly overworked bullpen in the early stages of the season.
  While the Dodgers didn't make a roster move ahead of playing the series finale against the Chicago Cubs, Brogdon is expected to join the team for their matchup against the Minnesota Twins, per Jack Harris of the L.A. Times
  Brogdon already is on the Dodgers' 40-man roster but a corresponding move will be required to get him active for the Twins series. That could be accomplished by optioning Michael Grove or Varland to Triple-A Oklahoma City.
  Grove has struggled in his role as a multi-inning relief pitcher and Varland is more organizational depth than bullpen mainstay.
  Brogdon and the rest of the Dodgers bullpen are going to trying backing James Paxton, Tyler Glasnow and Bobby Miller during the games at Target Field. Miller's start is coming on regular rest, making him the first Dodgers pitcher to take mound under such circumstances this season.
  Though, Miller's first start of the year also came on four days' rest from his outing in the exhibition Freeway Series.
  Connor Brogdon stats
  Brogdon was a key contributor for the Phillies during their run to the 2022 World Series but has struggled since that point.
  He made three appearances this year, allowing seven runs (six earned) in just two innings pitched. Brogdon's command was an issue as he walked batters during his three games and also allowed two home runs.
  The 29-year-old went 10-8 with a 3.88 ERA in 142 games (two starts) over parts of five seasons with the Phillies. He was selected by Philadelphia in the 10th round of the 2017 MLB Draft.
  Brogdon is out of Minor League options, which would require the Dodgers to place him on waivers if looking to remove him from their active roster.

West Chester (20-5-1, 9-5) continued their impressive form by stretching their winning streak to 10 games with a dominant doubleheader sweep (6-4, 5-3) of Mansfield (7-20, 3-15) at Serpico Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

The Golden Rams secured a 6-4 victory in the first game and a 5-3 triumph in the nightcap.

Joe Kaleck was a standout performer, going 3-for-3 at the plate with a walk, an RBI, and a run scored. The game was tied at 3-3 until West Chester exploded in the fifth inning, scoring three additional runs. Joe Kaleck and Anthony Boccio both delivered clutch RBI singles, while Sean Szestowicki contributed by getting hit by a pitch to bring home Boccio for the Golden Rams' sixth and final run of the game.

Kyle Lazer sealed the victory with his third save of the year in relief, while David Ferguson (4-0) earned the win by pitching four stellar innings, allowing just two hits and one run while recording a pair of strikeouts.

In the nightcap, Nick Noga showcased his pitching prowess, delivering five solid innings and conceding only two runs (one earned) on three hits while striking out five. The Golden Rams' offense also shined, scoring four runs in the top of the fourth inning courtesy of RBI singles by John DeMucci and Drew Simpson, along with an RBI sacrifice bunt from Boccio.

Evan Profy had a notable performance as well, finishing 2-for-4 at the plate for West Chester in the contest.

In Other Action

Jefferson (17-10, 6-4) put on a commanding display in their doubleheader against Chestnut Hill (8-21, 2-8) on Saturday, securing victories in both games.

The Rams dominated the first game, winning decisively with a score of 23-9, which also served as the Bill Giles Semifinal. They continued their impressive form in the second game, clinching a convincing 16-3 win.

The opening game witnessed an offensive onslaught from Jefferson, particularly in the later innings where they scored a remarkable 15 runs over the final three frames.

Marquise Wood had a standout performance, driving in six runs with his clutch hitting. The power hitters of the team, including Josh Lopez and Justin Espinal, contributed significantly with home runs, adding to the team's offensive explosion. Espinal's offensive impact was notable, as he also contributed five RBIs, showcasing his versatility at the plate.

On the pitching front, Sean Morgan delivered a solid performance in the nightcap, pitching five strong innings and allowing only one earned run. The Rams' pitching staff combined their efforts with the potent offense, creating a formidable challenge for Chestnut Hill throughout both games.

The Rams will await their opponent, either Wilmington or West Chester, in what promises to be an exciting title game for the Bill Giles Invitational at Citizens Bank Park.",2024-04-07T03:06:01Z,Citizens Bank,news,21,POSITIVE,0.6893333792686462,0.0006541644106619,0.3099134862422943,9.896181290969253e-05,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

If you build it, they might complain.
 An Arizona woman is speaking out after she says her neighbor, former MLB-All Star J.J. Hardy, started construction on a baseball field in his backyard.
 Pam Lang, a resident of Chandler, Arizona, told KPHO a decision to build the miniature ballpark across from her property goes ""beyond what is reasonable to expect your neighbors to tolerate.""
 ""I didn’t sign up to live next to a baseball field,"" she said. ""It’s like a commercial – like living next to Top Golf, you know.""
 The disgruntled neighbor explained she only realized what was going on once she saw 20-foot poles go up in her backyard. She has since filed a complaint with Maricopa County.
 ""It’s very disappointing and frustrating that all I can do is file a complaint and hope that somebody in the county feels like listening to me,"" she said.
 According to the report, Hardy has not received the necessary permits to build the field and has until April 22 to do so.
 Hardy, 41, spent over a decade playing in the league with the Milwaukee Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. A three-time Gold Glove recipient and two-time All-Star, Hardy retired in 2017 with a career batting average of.256, 188 home runs and 688 RBIs.",2024-04-06T19:55:05Z,Citizens Bank,news,21,NEUTRAL,0.0269791055470705,0.0810041353106498,0.8919684290885925,4.83927724417299e-05,POSITIVE,Social Internal,1,Environmental

"Community Corner Guilford Savings Bank Surpassed $300K Donations, Scholarships in 2023 Total donations and scholarships provided by the bank in 2023 totaled $306,000.

Total donations and scholarships provided by the bank in 2023 totaled $306,000. (Google Maps.)

GUILFORD, CT — Guilford Savings Bank (GSB) announced recently it surpassed $300,000 in donations and scholarships for the year 2023.

""In its 150-year journey, GSB, a community bank deeply rooted in its values, has consistently championed the belief that the prosperity of businesses is intricately tied to the well-being of the communities they serve,"" the bank said in a news release. ""This commitment is exemplified through the dedicated efforts of GSB employees, who volunteer countless hours to support nonprofit organizations and their commendable initiatives."" Total donations and scholarships provided by the bank in 2023 totaled $306,000.

GSB took a significant step in 2013 by establishing endowment funds at four community foundations: The Guilford Foundation (TGF), The Madison Foundation (TMF), Branford Community Foundation (BCF), and Community Foundation of Middlesex County (CFMC). This strategic move aimed to align with the bank's mission of addressing the diverse needs of its community members. The primary objectives of the endowment include providing annual scholarships, assisting low-to-moderate-income families, supporting the local community, addressing regional needs, and offering operational support for the Foundations along the central Connecticut shoreline and Middlesex County communities.

GSB's dedication to its philanthropic goals is underscored by its annual contributions to the endowment. Each year, the bank ensures that the fund receives substantial donations, solidifying its commitment to making a lasting impact on the community. This ongoing support guarantees that the Foundation remains a robust force for positive change well into the future. In response to the pandemic in March 2020 and annually since, GSB partnered with the four Foundations to fund $30,000-$40,000 in grant requests annually, solidifying its commitment to making a lasting impact on the community.

This significant portion of its community giving is channeled through its much more extensive reach rather than direct giving.

"Timothy Geelan, the president and CEO of Guilford Savings Bank, is stepping down after 10 years on the job and a year of chairing the Connecticut Bankers Association.
The bank announced his decision in an email Monday.
 Current Chief Operating Officer Kyle J. Eagleson will assume the role of president this month, and will succeed Geelan as CEO in March of next year, although Geelan will also continue to serve on the GSB board of directors after this.
 “I want everyone to know that it has been and continues to be my privilege to serve GSB since 1994, and for the past 10 years as its President and CEO. It’s an honor to come to work every day with so many caring, dedicated people who have been part of our GSB family for all these years. I am keenly aware that none of what we’ve accomplished in my tenure was possible without the hard work and collaboration with our Board of Directors, Corporators and most importantly, our employees. Their trust and commitment are something I have never taken for granted,” Geelan said in a statement. “GSB has come a long way, and accomplished much over nearly 150 years to become the strong, stable, thriving financial institution it is today. I am thankful to all my current and past colleagues who served each other in pursuit of continuing to improve delivering on the financial wellbeing and experience for our loyal clients, non-profit partners, and our entire community.”
 The bank’s announcement credited Geelan with leading the bank to roughly double its assets during his tenure, growing employee headcount by over 200 percent, expanding its branch network and leading it through the COVID-19 pandemic, when it delivered $41 million in PPP loans to 431 businesses. In addition, the announcement said, “Geelan ushered in a transformation of GSB’s retail banking model, through partnerships with MANTL, Jack Henry and others, to deploy a fully integrated, technologically advanced banking platform that delivers greater efficiency, and a frictionless customer experience.”
 In a statement, GSB board chair Bill Lee said the bank had long ago planned to make Eagleson the new leader once Geelan retired.
 “We are confident that Kyle is the perfect person for the position, and we look forward to working with him and Tim during this transition,” he said. “The Board thanks Tim for his many decades of service to the bank, his sharing his plans well in advance so that we can have a smooth transition and for his willingness to stay on as a director of the bank. We congratulate Kyle and look forward to working together with him for many years.”
 In a statement, Geelan called Eagleson “the best person to lead GSB into the future, embodying its community roots and commitment to innovation.”
 Eagleson joined GSB in 2008 as treasurer, and was subsequently promoted to his current role in 2014 and has been part of the bank’s executive leadership as first vice president, CFO and COO since 2016.

He is also the founder of the local Eagle’s Cup Classic, a charity golf tournament named in honor of his father, a 9/11 victim.
 “It’s impossible to overstate what Tim has done for GSB. With his leadership, GSB has grown stronger, and better positioned to bring community banking to all of Connecticut and its neighbors, while also remaining responsive to the evolving needs of our clients who seek forward thinking, innovative community banking,” Eagleson said in a statement. “He has served GSB well and set our organization up for continued success. I am humbled by this opportunity, but also emboldened to deliver on our shared vision, and continue to work with our employees, Board of Directors, Corporators and our communities, to move our tremendous institution forward.”

"After decades of power outages and concerns over seniors not receiving food, The Estuary was grateful to receive funding from the Community Foundation of Middlesex County, Essex Community Fund, Guilford Savings Bank, Meals on Wheels America, the Nancy Fischbach and Martin Wolman Fund at the Community Foundation of Middlesex County, and Westbrook Foundation to purchase a generator. This multi-year project, delayed by supply chain issues, was finally completed this winter. The generator will help ensure that even during power outages – large or small – seniors will still receive the critical nutrition that they need and that the program doesn't suffer from food losses due to downed freezers. The Estuary expressed its gratitude to the community funders who helped make this project possible.
 “Knowing that we have their support and that they will stand side by side with us as we fight food insecurity in our senior population is a gift,” said Heather Milardo, director of development and outreach for The Estuary.
  The Estuary is a regional non-profit senior center that serves over 1,000 clients annually and provides over 80,000 meals through its nutrition program, including Meals on Wheels and Congregate Dining. This program is supported in part by the Senior Resources - Agency on Aging with Title III funds made available under the Older Americans Act.

"Evanston Reparations Committee Chair Robin Rue Simmons announced the $17 million in the city’s reparations fund would be transferred to Black-owned Liberty Bank.

Simmons shared the news during the April 4 Reparations Committee meeting calling the move the “biggest deal” since the reparations program was approved.

“This is a way that this repair can be multiplied,” Simmons said. “$17 million in a Black bank is going to give more lending power and access to Black businesses, Black mortgages that are fair and other forms of support so this is a very, very big deal.”

The bank is valued at a billion dollars with the closest branch in Park Forest.

“If we have inspired more than 100 municipalities to do reparations, what if they follow this model?” Simmons said. “Let’s not be scared to dream.”

Committee Member Krissie Harris called the move “amazing” saying it’s further proof that the reparations work Evanston is doing is “instrumental.”

Liberty Bank also provided services for first time home buyers who chose to use their reparations funding for mortgages, with Committee Member Claire McFarland Barber saying she’s happy the city was able to pay that help forward.

Simmons also said the bank has offered 100% refinancing on predatory loans, special savings accounts and mortgage products.

“They have been invested and committed early on, years ago,” Simmons said.

The committee also heard a presentation by Loyola University Chicago Associate Professor of Political Science Twyla Blackmond Larnell on a study to explore how to better support Black owned businesses. She is hoping to expand on a similar 1996 study the city completed by looking at other aspects that impact Black owned businesses. Beyond looking for recommendations on how to move forward, the study hopes to look into the current racial economic disparities in Evanston, how the issue has evolved, what advantages/disadvantages previous interventions have had and what policies and programs can be implemented to minimize disparities.

“What we do know is that oftentimes, Black business owners spend more money to open their businesses, maintain their business and even still have high failure rates,” she said.

The expansion of the study will include surveys and feedback from Black Evanston business owners, something that was missing from the 1996 study. Blackmond Larnell plans to look at new data gathered in the nearly 30 years since the previous study and use that to compare Evanston Black-owned businesses to their competitors and identify barriers making successful business ownership more difficult for Black owners.

“What we really want to get at is how can we ensure that we have covered all of our bases when it comes to governmental stipulations around diversity, affirmative action programs when we make these recommendations,” she said. “A big part of this is having to take the time to not just come up with ideas but ideas that can stand the test of time. By the test of time, I specifically mean the Supreme Court.”

Blackmond Larnell said the burden of proof is on the government to show the policy is necessary to address the problem, a measure she says can be very difficult.

The study is expected to take about eight months.

“If we want more resources for the Black community, there’s power in numbers,” she said. “We have to have enough resources and amenities to maintain our Black population so that they can then open the businesses and support the businesses, feel included and stay.”",2024-04-08T17:21:54Z,Liberty Bank,news,11,NEUTRAL,0.0451538972556591,0.0685201734304428,0.8860338926315308,0.000292024022201,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

"Communion opened in 2020 in the Liberty Bank Building, which housed the first Black-owned bank in the Pacific Northwest.
 SEATTLE — A soul food restaurant in Seattle's Central District neighborhood has garnered a James Beard Award nomination this year.
  Chef Kristi Brown of Communion was nominated for Best Chef in the Northwest and Pacific region.
  ""This nomination not only acknowledges the effort we dedicate to Communion but also serves as a tribute to our incredible staff who play a crucial role in making Communion a welcoming sanctuary, a space where you feel at home,"" the restaurant said in a statement on its website.
  Brown and her son Daron Bomar, co-owner and general manager, opened the restaurant in December 2020.
  Communion sits on the ground floor of the Liberty Bank Building. The original building housed the first Black-owned bank in the Pacific Northwest.
  The menu at Communion is “rooted in traditional American soul food,” but also blends Pacific Northwest influences. It includes classics like black-eyed peas, New Orleans-style seafood gumbo and beef short ribs.
  The James Beard Awards, which were first awarded in 1991, recognize achievement in culinary arts, as well as a commitment to equity, community and sustainability. They are among the most prestigious honors in the restaurant industry.
  The 2024 winners will be announced during an awards ceremony in Chicago on June 10.
  Pancita is one of several other Washington state restaurants and chefs who were named finalists for a James Beard Award this year. Other finalists include the following:
  Outstanding Restaurateur: Quynh-Vy and Yenvy Pham, Phở Bắc Súp Shop, Phởcific Standard Time, and The Boat in Seattle.

"Effective immediately, a minimum of $17 million will be deposited into Liberty Bank from the Evanston Reparations Fund.
The Reparations Committee announced that it will deposit the Evanston Reparations Fund into Liberty Bank, one of the largest Black-owned banks in America, at the committee’s Thursday meeting.
 Effective immediately, a minimum of $17 million will be deposited.
 “Seventeen million dollars in a Black bank is going to give more lending power and access to Black businesses, Black mortgages and other forms of support,” Committee Chair Robin Rue Simmons said.
 The fund currently supports initiatives like the Restorative Housing Program, which aims to increase homeownership, build wealth and intergenerational equity among the city’s Black residents and improve the retention of Black homeowners in the city.
 Simmons called the partnership “the biggest deal since the passing of Resolution 126-R-19 in 2019,” which established both the Reparations Fund and Reparations Committee.
 This announcement comes against the backdrop of both the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and a bill making its way through the Tennessee State Legislature that prohibits local governments from funding studies of or disbursing reparations.
 The ancestor recipients — adult residents of Evanston between 1919 and 1969 — have received approximately $3 million in reparations, according to Assistant to the City Manager Tasheik Kerr. Direct descendants of ancestors have received almost $1.6 million.
 The committee also heard a research proposal from political science Prof. Twyla Blackmond Larnell of Loyola University Chicago. Larnell spoke about ways to best support Black entrepreneurs by identifying racial patterns in Evanston’s business activity.
 Larnell said her research will be closely modeled after a 1996 study about local business disparities in Evanston. She will expand on the study by taking into account additional aspects that have a large impact on Black businesses. This includes the status of Evanston’s racial economic disparities and how the issue has evolved over time. The committee unanimously approved Larnell’s proposal.
 Larnell hopes her research will go beyond being just published. Instead, she said she wants to create evidence-based recommendations for the city that can withstand scrutiny in court systems.
 The committee also received an update from the reparations program’s construction administrator, Michael Dykes. Dykes collaborates with reparations recipients who want to improve their homes. He and Simmons stressed their vision for home improvements and repairs to be done by Black contractors, adding economic benefits to the Black community.
 “All of our contractors are local, and all of them are Black,” Dykes said.
 He hopes this will help promote economic activity within Evanston’s Black community.
 Larnell said Evanston needs enough resources to maintain the city’s Black population so that they can open and support Black businesses.
 “We have seen — not just in Evanston, but this whole entire area — an exodus of Black residents, business owners, etcetera,” Larnell said. “This has economic ramifications for the Black community, but it also has political ramifications for the Black community.”

"HARTFORD, Conn. - Hartford Athletic proudly announced today the renewal of partnerships with Founding Partners Trinity Health Of New England, The Hartford, Stanley Black & Decker, and Liberty Bank.
 ""We are thrilled and grateful to all our sponsors and marketing partners for their continued support. From day one of this franchise launching in 2019, the commitments of our Founding Partners has been simply amazing,"" said Hartford Athletic CEO Nick Sakiewicz. ""Each one of them brings excellence in different areas and business categories that help our club reach all parts of the Greater Hartford community. Their continued commitment and unwavering support have been key in our journey and we are excited for the future of these partnerships.""
  Trinity Health Of New England has stood as the Official HealthCare Provider of Hartford Athletic since 2019, and their partnership was enhanced when they became the Naming Rights Partner of Trinity Health Stadium in 2022. The Trinity Health Of New England logo is also prominently placed on the front of the team's home and away jerseys. Trinity Health Of New England will sponsor multiple events, including the anticipated home opener this Saturday and the annual Community Health Night on June 1st, dedicated to promoting health and wellness awareness among fans.
  The Hartford, an Official Insurance and Community Partner of Hartford Athletic, has over 200 years of experience serving the community and has centered their partnership with Hartford Athletic around youth since 2019. They have been the presenting partner of some of the Club's most interactive match day experiences, including the High Five Tunnel, Ceremonial Walkout with Hartford Athletic players, and the Junior Fire Marshal Halftime Challenge. The Hartford is also the presenting partner of the annual Junior Fire Marshal Night, which takes life-saving lessons about fire safety and makes them fun for kids to learn while attending a Hartford Athletic match. The partnership also includes collaboration with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford and the Workforce Development Program.
  Stanley Black & Decker, rooted in Connecticut for over 175 years, has been central to Hartford Athletic's commitment to adding cultural vibrancy to the region. Bringing their unparalleled expertise in the trade industry to the partnership, Hartford Athletic and Stanley Black & Decker collaborated to execute the first ever Grow the Trades Night in 2023, bringing together various trade organizations to Trinity Health Stadium for a pre-match tabling event. Grow the Trades Night will return on July 26th, and Stanley Black & Decker will continue their supporting sponsorship of STEM and Soccer Education Day and the Hartford Athletic Hiring Expo.

"Business & Tech Raising Cane's Requests Change To Milford Parking Requirements A fast-food restaurant planning a location at a former Milford Bank branch is requesting a change to parking regulations.

A fast-food restaurant planning a location in Milford is requesting a change to parking regulations. (Saul Flores/Patch)

MILFORD, CT — Raising Cane's, a popular chain known for its fried chicken, is requesting to alter minimum off-street parking requirements.

Raising Cane's is planning on adding its third location in the state at the 1455 Boston Post Road site, a former Milford Bank branch. The existing parking standard is one space per 75 square feet of floor space at a restaurant. Raising Cane's is seeking to change that to one space per 150 square feet of floor space specifically for fast-food restaurants.

The current owner of the property, 1455 BPR, LLC, noted in a petition requesting the change that there is no distinction in the parking requirements for fast-food restaurants. ""In light of the existing definition, as well as modern drive-through habits, it makes little sense to require a 'fast-food restaurant' to provide the same number of parking spaces that a regular sit-down restaurant would be required to provide,"" the petition stated.

The petition also argued that the change to parking mirrors regulations in other municipalities. City Planner David Sulkis said in the staff review/comments section of the document that the ""proposed change is consistent with the Plan of Conservation and Development for modernization of our parking standards.""

The Planning and Zoning Commission will hold a public hearing on the change at its meeting Tuesday at 7 p.m. at City Hall. Raising Cane's was founded in 1996 in Baton Rouge, LA, and has since expanded to more than 600 locations in the U.S. and overseas. The business employs around 50,000 people and is known for its focus on chicken fingers.

"To the Editor: I’d like to take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Matthew Mihalcik, I am seeking reelection for Legislative Council District 2.
I am currently employed by Newtown Savings Bank as a small business lender. I have been very involved in the small business community as the past president of the Southbury Business Association and most recently the vice president of the Chamber of Commerce of Newtown. Additionally, I co-own a small business in Sandy Hook with my wife Melissa.
 My volunteerism started at a young age when I was a Boy Scout earning the highest honor, the Eagle Scout Award. I attended Central Connecticut State University and majored in criminology and minored in political science.
 I moved to town in 2012 and shortly thereafter was appointed to the Economic Development Commission by First Selectman Pat Llodra. Shortly thereafter, I was also appointed to the Board of Directors of the C.H. Booth Library where I was also the race director for the annual Turkey Trot road race benefiting the library. In 2019, I was elected to the Board of Finance, which enabled me to use my finance experience and commitment to volunteerism.
 I will work to ensure that the town retains its great rating by bond agencies, the schools are funded appropriately and there are great places for everyone to enjoy in the open space, town parks and community center. Our community is very special and if reelected to the Legislative Council I will work to ensure that Newtown is a great place for all to live, work and thrive.

"TRUMBULL — A New York has been arrested after attempting to make fraudulent transactions at Newtown Savings Bank, police say.

In a release, Trumbull police Lt. Eric Weir said Daniel Ervin, a 38-year-old from Binghamton, N.Y., was arrested a short distance from the bank on Friday after attempting to make a transaction and being recognized by an employee who saw him during a withdrawal he made the day before.

Weir said Trumbull police were notified around 5 p.m. of a man who returned to the bank at 926 White Plains Road and attempted to deposit a check for more than $3,000. Due to Ervin’s illegal activity the previous day, he said, and him having no documentation to support having access to the account, he eventually left the bank after being denied the option to make any further transactions.

Weir said Ervin was located walking a short distance away from the bank where he was taken into police custody. He said he was found to be in possession of a fraudulent HSBC Premier credit card under another individual’s name, as well as two Newtown Savings Bank receipts that were dated Aug, 31 that showed the previous fraudulent transactions.

That day, Weir said, Ervin was successful in using fraudulent identification to withdraw $2,000 from a business account. During that event, he said, Ervin provided a Massachusetts driver's license with his own picture on it, but with the victim’s name and address.

Weir said Ervin was charged with two counts of criminal impersonation, third-degree identity theft, second-degree forgery, third-degree forgery and credit card forgery.

  TRUMBULL — A New York has been arrested after attempting to make fraudulent transactions at Newtown Savings Bank, police say.
  In a release, Trumbull police Lt. Eric Weir said Daniel Ervin, a 38-year-old from Binghamton, N.Y., was arrested a short distance from the bank on Friday after attempting to make a transaction and being recognized by an employee who saw him during a withdrawal he made the day before.
  Weir said Trumbull police were notified around 5 p.m. of a man who returned to the bank at 926 White Plains Road and attempted to deposit a check for more than $3,000. Due to Ervin's illegal activity the previous day, he said, and him having no documentation to support having access to the account, he eventually left the bank after being denied the option to make any further transactions.
  Weir said Ervin was located walking a short distance away from the bank where he was taken into police custody. He said he was found to be in possession of a fraudulent HSBC Premier credit card under another individual's name, as well as two Newtown Savings Bank receipts that were dated Aug, 31 that showed the previous fraudulent transactions.
  That day, Weir said, Ervin was successful in using fraudulent identification to withdraw $2,000 from a business account. During that event, he said, Ervin provided a Massachusetts driver's license with his own picture on it, but with the victim's name and address.
  Weir said Ervin was charged with two counts of criminal impersonation, third-degree identity theft, second-degree forgery, third-degree forgery and credit card forgery.

"Genesee Regional Bank was formed in 1996 to serve small business clients in the Rochester, Watertown and Central New York communities. When the community bank launched, it set out to meet the needs of their clients for today and tomorrow. From this original vision, the Bank has grown rapidly to become one of the leading mortgage lenders in the region, with more than$800 million in assets.



As the Genesee Regional Bank grew and mortgage technology became more innovative, it began to evaluate its mortgage needs. GRB was introduced to nCino’s Mortgage Suite and the platform immediately stood out to the Bank.



“We sought out a solution that would help us evolve with the technology that was already beginning to change the shape of our industry,” said Joe Leone, Mortgage Operations Manager at Genesee Regional Bank. “In addition to the user-friendly aspect of nCino’s technology, one of the other reasons we chose the solution is we could see it was starting to think about the next step, such as disclosures and eClosings.”

Avon Historical Society

AVON, CT — Efforts building a new Avon Historical Society Museum recently received a major boost courtesy of a local bank foundation donation. The Northwest Community Bank Foundation recently awarded a $1,000 grant to the Avon Historical Society.

According to the foundation, the funds will go toward the creation of interpretive history panels in their new museum opening in 2024. The “Avon History Museum” will be at 8 E. Main St. (Route 44) in a 200-year-old one-room schoolhouse currently under renovation.

It will contain wall panels and artifact displays covering more than 400 years of the history of the town which was first called Nod, then Northington, and finally Avon. The donation comes as the historical society is going all-in on a paver brick-buying campaign to raise money for the museum.

The bricks, which will adorn public walkways outside the museum, can be purchased as gifts for the holiday season.

"STAGE @ THE WARNER PRESENTS  Agatha Christie's  MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS  Adapted by Ken Ludwig
 November 4 - 19, 2023 in the Nancy Marine Studio Theatre
  Sponsored by Northwest Community Bank
  Director: Keith Paul | Production Stage Manager: Craig Clavette
  Torrington, CT – Stage @ the Warner is proud to present Agatha Christie's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, November 4 - 19 in the Nancy Marine Studio Theatre.
  Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. Isolated and with a killer in their midst, the passengers rely on detective Hercule Poirot to identify the murderer – in case he or she decides to strike again. Ken Ludwig's clever adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic boasts all the glamour, intrigue and suspense of Dame Agatha's celebrated novel, with a healthy dose of humor to quicken the pace.
  PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE:
  Saturday, November 4 – 8 pm
  Sunday, November 5 – 2 pm
  Friday, November 10 – 8 pm

Northwest Community Bank has maintained a strong trajectory of growth with assets approaching the $1.1 billion mark. With the loyal support of our customers, dedicated employees and insightful leadership, we deepened our already strong position. Under one bank charter with our Divisions – Collinsville Bank and Litchfield Bancorp – Northwest Community Bank met and exceeded our established goals. As a mutual institution, we have sustained the core values we were founded upon and are distinctly different from regional and national banks. We ended 2022 with healthy earnings and a strong balance sheet.

Serving Our Commercial and Personal Customers

While sustaining our tradition of building relationships with all of our customers, we have increased the ability to provide larger commercial loans and serve a greater number of businesses and consumers. We continue to invest in products, services, technology and training to compete – and offer the best service possible.

We also are constantly introducing new products, technology updates, security measures and communications. At the same time, we are active participants in many community organizations and events.

Expanding Our Support to Community

The Northwest Community Bank Foundation was funded and organized on Jan. 1, 2022, as a separate nonprofit entity. The Foundation extends the Bank’s ability to contribute to nonprofit agencies and organizations working in the communities we serve.

Image

As a mutual savings bank, it is our mission to give back to the communities we serve. In 2022 the new Foundation awarded 66 grants totaling $425,000. Combined with the $300,000 donated through the Bank’s traditional Corporate Giving Program, the Bank contributed $725,000 to nonprofit organizations in our market area.

Recognizing the Talent and Dedication

in Our Management and Employees

Our most valuable assets are our people. From our newest Universal Banker, through every department, to the managers and executives, we have benefitted from their professionalism and team effort. They are the bedrock of our success. Their efforts have left us well positioned to address the global, domestic, local and personal conditions that affect us all.

Last fall, the Board of Directors embarked on a comprehensive search for the next President and CEO. [President Steve Reilly expressed his plan to retire on Sept. 1, 2023.] Following a thorough process and search, the bank’s current Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Maura Malo, has been selected to become President and CEO in September. We could not be more pleased to promote from within and are confident we’ll experience a smooth, seamless transition of leadership.

We are committed to continuing our prudent management, and are most appreciative of our loyal customers and dedicated employees. Our customers are our best ambassadors, and we could not be more grateful for that.

Since our founding, we have experienced many challenges and changes, and today we are equipped and prepared to address the times ahead.

"Highest rating given for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) compliance
DANBURY, Conn. - Aug. 4, 2023 - PRLog --
 Savings Bank of Danbury (http://sbdanbury.com) has received an ""Outstanding"" rating from the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) for its compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).
 The FDIC released its list today, detailing the specific ratings that it assigned to banks across the nation earlier this year.
 The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) was enacted in 1977 and encourages banks and savings associations to help meet the credit needs of all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals. CRA applies to FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks.
 Regulators assess the record of each bank in fulfilling its obligation to the community and consider that record in evaluating and approving applications for charters, bank mergers, acquisitions, and branch openings. A bank is evaluated on its record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations.
 Martin G. Morgado, President and Chief Executive Officer at Savings Bank of Danbury, said, ""We are very pleased to once again receive a rating of 'Outstanding' from the FDIC regarding Community Reinvestment Act compliance. For us, meeting and supporting the needs of the communities that we serve has always been a top priority, and will continue to be so going forward.""

First and foremost, it's 2023, and even if there's a blue check mark on whatever verified social media account there is, I will never provide any kind of personal information online. Be like me.

"The Susan B. Anthony Project is holding the annual fundraiser, 'Walk a Mile in Her Shoes'which challenges teams of walkers to wear red high heels
and raise funds for the agency to help survivors of domestic violence. Pictured is the team for Torrington Savings Bank.
 TORRINGTON — Susan B. Anthony Project’s 6th annual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes will return May 21 to the center of Litchfield. The Walk is the largest annual fundraising event for SBAP, which provides crisis and support services to domestic and sexual violence victims in northwest Connecticut.
 During the walk, men and boys lead the way on the road to end interpersonal violence by literally walking a mile in women’s high heeled shoes. All genders, ages, and abilities are welcome to participate, and the high heeled shoes are optional.
 While participants are encouraged to join live event on May 21, options are still available for those who wish to take part virtually. Red high heels are available to Walkers who wish to walk an actual mile around Litchfield center, or simply for photo opportunities to raise awareness. Groups may also choose to host their own team walks on a day and place of their choosing, with assistance and support from SBAP staff.
 In addition to walking and fundraising as an individual or as part of a team, those interested in supporting the event and SBAP’s services are invited to sponsor the walk, pledge a walker, place an ad in the event program, purchase merchandise, make a general donation, or spread the word about the event and raise awareness about the issues of domestic and sexual violence in our community.
 Susan B. Anthony Project’s 6th annual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes is sponsored by SBAP Agency Sponsors Dymax Corporation, M&T Bank, Northwest Community Bank and Its Divisions, O&G Industries, Pillar to Post Home Inspectors, Thomaston Savings Bank, Torrington Savings Bank, twenty2 wallpaper, Union Savings Bank, and Webster Bank, and by Event Sponsors The BakeHouse, Beauty Mark Tattooing, Kirstin Etela, Forman School, Gengras Subaru, RAR Excavating, Sullivan Automotive Group, and Tile America. Sponsorship opportunities are still available to interested businesses and individuals.

 Walk a Mile in Her Shoes, created by Frank Baird in 2001, is an international men’s march where men and boys lead the way on the road to end sexual and domestic violence by walking a mile in women’s high heels. Created by men, the Walk gives participants the opportunity to get their communities talking about a difficult subject while increasing awareness of the problem, offering opportunities for healing, and demonstrating men’s willingness to walk with women and children as allies, advocates, and survivors.

"BRISTOL – The Bristol Blues revealed their new mascot Wednesday and the name has been chosen by popular vote after the Thanksgiving “Battle for the Bell.”

“Mojo,” a wolf with a cool hat and shades, suspenders and a bowtie, came to the local branch of Torrington Savings Bank, the postseason sponsor of the Blues, to “open a bank account.” There, he was welcomed by Torrington Savings Bank President and CEO Lesa Vanotti and her staff.

“We’re proud to be a sponsor of the Blues and very excited to meet Mojo,” Vanotti said.

Sarah Lucian, community relations director for the Bristol Blues, said the team is excited to partner with Torrington Savings Bank and that’s why they chose the branch as the spot to reveal the name of their new mascot.

Mojo made his first appearance during the Battle for the Bell at Muzzy Field and fans were able to vote on a giant poster board for the mascot’s new name.

“Third place had 199 votes, so your name is not Jasper,” Lucian said to the mascot. “Second place had 290 votes, so your name is not Ace. With 347 votes, you’re Mojo.”

Lucian said young Bristol Blues fans tipped the scale in the naming contest.

“Just about every kid voted for Mojo,” she said.

Lucian wished everyone in attendance “Happy Holidays” and said the Blues are excited for their next season. Following a strong season, where the team finished 32-12, the nonprofit baseball team is headed into its eighth season in June 2023. Tickets will remain $6.

The Blues, Lucian said, had been working on an updated mascot after the previous mascot “BB” went into “retirement.” He left on a high note, with last year’s season seeing high fan attendance and the team holding several “promo nights” to support a variety of causes.

  By 2022, Barnhart expanded its fleet to 170 trucks.It's unclear if the carmaker plans to disable either feature for power users, but if it chose to, Tesla could disable or modify the feature using its over-the-air software updates.19 billion in the fourth quarter ended September, up 5% from the previous year.It starts with the customer To co-founder Tim Barnhart, the secret to success is clear.""It's not a special pill or deal.FSD is an add-on to Tesla's Autopilot driver assist program.It's always just been about customer service,"" he said.A maniacal focus on exceeding every customer's expectations and a talent for networking with vendors, drivers, and suppliers drove Barnhart's expansion in the US and globally.The software enables Teslas to automatically change lanes, enter and exit highways, recognize stop signs and traffic lights, and park.Whether a beauty brand stands the test of time ultimately seems to rest on how much personal capital a celebrity or influencer is willing to invest into it.
  The Barnhart team encompasses 60 company drivers, 110 independent contractors, and 70 staff members — all working together to ensure the Barnhart name is associated with excellent customer service.Barnhart Transportation It's not a special pill or deal.Tesla's FSD software has faced criticism in the past.It's always just been about customer service.Tim Barnhart, co-founder of Barnhart Transportation To Tim and Bryan, their employees are just another addition to their family.Last year, the California Department of Motor Vehicles.And once a part of the Barnhart family, the company shows its employees the same dedication it would show a valued client by always going the extra mile — even during a pandemic.
  ""2020 was probably our worst year for us in business,"" Tim said.""But, we kept everybody 100% employed."" The Barnharts turned business back around by casting a wider net onto new ventures, like their public commercial tank wash service located in Northeast Pennsylvania that makes their liquid tank operations more efficient, allowing them to better serve their customers.Diversify to thrive Well before the pandemic, both brothers knew they needed to diversify their capabilities to stay on top of a highly competitive logistics industry.A financial partner was the solution, but to the Barnharts, it couldn't be just anyone.
  First and foremost, they wanted a partner whose dedication to teamwork, integrity, shared values, and five-star customer service mirrored theirs.Citizens quickly became that trusted partner at their management table.Barnhart Transportation Together, their teamwork's impact is evidenced by the growing breadth of Barnhart Transportation's reach.Tim and Bryan now serve their customers and community in multiple regions, which includes three warehouses in the Charleston, South Carolina market.The expansion and presence in this""Regional HQ"" allow the company to grow its offerings to reach a more extensive customer base, like those on the East Coast.
  In addition to its headquarters, Barnhart diversifies itself by also owning fleet and warehouse operations in Northwest Pennsylvania and investing in high-growth customer markets such as South Carolina and Texas.The power of saying 'yes' Another way the company climbed its way to the top: Where others see obstacles, the Barnharts see opportunity.One of their acquired warehouses located in the small town of Moncks Corner, SC, was initially a dumping ground for hazardous materials and pests after it lay abandoned from bankruptcy.Even when the state of South Carolina poured millions into the cleanup because of outcries from the community, the site remained unusable.Barnhart Transportation Barnhart Transportation Show less The Barnharts stepped in to acquire and revitalize the property that threatened the health and lives of nearby residents.
  The project would not only improve environmental conditions but also create jobs for the people of Moncks Corner.And because Citizens, much like Barnhart, values supporting business growth projects in their communities, they helped fund the expansion — now slated for an official grand opening in January 2023.Living by their motto,""Driven By You,"" has helped the Barnharts meet the needs of their customers, drivers, and employees.Their dedication to customer service and delivering innovative solutions has helped drive the company's success..",2023-01-11T23:24:14Z,Citizens Bank,news,21,,,,,,POSITIVE,Environmental,1,Environmental

Banking Circle US offers a fully cloud-based, financial infrastructure to support real-time, global clearing and settlements for both domestic and cross-border payment services, according to a news release from Lamont's office. (Google Maps.)

STAMFORD, CT — Banking Circle, a European fintech payments bank, opened its United States headquarters in Stamford on Tuesday.

Gov. Ned Lamont and CT Banking Commissioner Jorge Perez took part in a ceremony at the company's new HQ, located at 750 Washington Blvd. ""Connecticut is fast becoming the destination of choice for fintech companies to grow and thrive,"" said Lamont in a news release. ""I would like to welcome Banking Circle US to Connecticut’s business community. Here you will find the support and talent you need to continue to innovate in this space and lead the way for expansion.""

The company recently received its charter and certificate of authority from the Connecticut Department of Banking. The charter provides a customized regulatory solution to financial technology companies looking to grow in a competitive marketplace.



""The charter is ideal for companies engaged in a variety of financial activities seeking to integrate a banking function, but whose business plan does not include taking retail deposits from individuals,"" a news release from Lamont's office said. ""The charter provides a responsible, streamlined, and flexible regulatory approach allowing companies to operate across the U.S. The charter also provides a beneficial exemption to money services laws in many other states, reducing regulatory burden."" Perez noted that Banking Circle US is the first company to take advantage of the charter.

""We look forward to working with Banking Circle and fostering a relationship that provides expert supervision and the regulatory experience to help them thrive,"" Perez noted. Banking Circle US offers a fully cloud-based, financial infrastructure to support real-time, global clearing and settlements for both domestic and cross-border payment services, according to a news release from Lamont's office.

The company’s mission is to eliminate the time and cost of cross-border payments, enabling a way for both U.S. and foreign banks, financial institutions, payment service providers, marketplaces, and corporate entities to manage their financial needs. ""After ramping up operations in Stamford back in October of 2022, and building out our office, our team, and our technology, we are thrilled to announce that as of Feb. 1, 2024, we have begun our commercial operations with the processing of payments for our first client,"" Banking Circle US Chief Executive Officer Kjeld Olson said in a news release. ""We would like to thank Gov. Lamont, Banking Commissioner Jorge L. Perez, and the entire team at the Connecticut Department of Banking for collaborating with us to achieve this milestone. We are excited to share our story and proud to open as the first new bank in Connecticut in nearly ten years."" Banking Circle US's offices are located near the Stamford Transportation Center, which provides easy access to the Northeast Corridor and a diverse talent pool for employment needs. Additionally, Connecticut’s banking charter allows Banking Circle US to enter the U.S. market with its current ownership structure.

""The Connecticut charter matches very well with the Banking Circle US business case of delivering faster, cost-efficient payments and banking services to financial technology service providers,"" said Anders la Cour, co-founder of Banking Circle, board chairman and Banking Circle Group CEO. ""That includes banks, payment providers, card acquirers and marketplaces and all the covered customers they serve. We believe that the bank will provide benefits for the public and the local community in the form of increased employment and well-paid jobs, improved payment services and recognition of Connecticut as a leader in fostering improved banking services to the economy,"" la Cour added. Since ramping up its operations in Stamford, the office has grown to include 24 employees and contractors. ""We anticipate a considerable increase in future hiring of full-time employees within the next three to four years, which will help contribute to the growth of the local economy,"" Olson said in a news release. Stamford Director of Economic Development Leah Kagan welcomed Banking Circle US to the city.

""We are excited that they choose Stamford as their U.S. headquarters and know they are in good company with our growing fintech community and international companies,"" Kagan said.
